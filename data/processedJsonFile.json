The relationship between my brother and Mia is very toxic mostly because of him, he\u2019s very controlling and gets jealous a lot, he knows how to control her . Meanwhile Mia is very in my opinion trauma bonded to him because she suffered some bad stuff from her mom\u2019s ex boyfriend\u2026he was like messing with her at night. From what she told me my brother was really there for her and helped her feel normal again. Then Mia is also religious and my brother was her first for alot of things if you catch my drift, and I think she thinks he\u2019s supposed to be her husband and she needs to be with him..so there whole relationship is just mess.\n\nAlthough the situation that brings me here is Mia and my brother were arguing all day Sunday he wanted to take the baby out to meet his friends and she told him no because she feels like he still too little. But that didn\u2019t stop my brother getting mad  at her and she was like in the recliner breastfeeding the baby and she asked him to bring like a certain medicine to give the baby. I\u2019m not even sure what it was but it had someone weight to its like an inhaler...he ignores her the first few times she asked and he finally does give to her\u2026but I kid you not he quite literally chucks it at her hard. While she\u2019s holding my nephew and this I could tell scared her and she looked at my brother very obviously scared of him.

        "Body": "First time posting here but I am seriously in need of a reality check. I want to know who is in the wrong because I'm not able to look at the situation as clearly anymore. \n\nBACKSTORY:\n\nMy boyfriend (M45) and I F(27) met in 2022 when I started working at the same restaurant as he already did. We didn't really talk much but 6 months in to me working there is when he started to show interest and tried to pursue me. Took about 3 months of that for me to give him a chance. After our first time hanging out he told me he had been single for some time and that he was looking for someone to do stuff with like concerts, dinners, vacations etc. but keep it light. Being I am 17 years younger he also said he wouldn't want anything too serious with me since he wouldn't want to \"steal my youth\" or take away any experiences I should be having at my age. I said I love all those things and I would be down but that I thought he was full of it and just trying to spit some game at me. He asked me to name an artist I liked and if I have ever been to Hawaii to which I said yes (he had never been.) A couple days later he booked us a trip to Hawaii but we had to stop in Las Vegas first to go see the artist I liked who would be performing the day before our flights to Hawaii. I was surprised it wasn't all talk. Over that vacation we had a mix of fun and getting to know each other and how we are as partners in relationships to which I promptly said I cook but I am not the best with cleaning to which he said if I cook he would have zero issue doing his part by cleaning and doing any \"manly\" duties. This was the start of our relationship and we had been together ever since. We moved in with each other in 2023. \n\n\nTODAY'S ISSUE:\n\nFast forward to now, I haven't worked with him in a while but he uses work as an excuse not to do his part or the bare minimum. His motto has always been \"quick and easy\" and it's really getting to me that he is the lead server at his job never calls out and people praise all his hard work and efforts yet he comes home \"too tired\" for anything more as if I don't work myself. \"But I work REALLY hard\" is what I'm usually understanding of however that doesn't mean you get to check out. I've seen his work ethic because I worked there and it's amazing I just wish there was some of that leftover for our home and our relationship. He goes out of his way to give co workers rides and help people which I really do love but once he's in the door it's immediately to the couch and what's for dinner.\n\nYesterday (12/29) was our 2 year anniversary which he PROMISED he would take the day off whether he had to request it off or call out he would make it happen for me. My only requests were to spend the day together and it would be nice if he could make the reservation so I could be somewhat surprised. He didn't feel like making the reservation anywhere and said \"ugh baby just pick one!\" So I made two at places I like. Two days before the date he tried to tell me he wants to go to work to which I was very upset because he's had months notice of this and he could easily request or switch the days off with his coworkers. He asked off new years day but not our date which upset me even more like you could have done both or just chose the one. He realized I was upset and said he would keep his word and that he understands my feelings. The 28th at 10pm I got off work to call him and asked if I should pick up something to drink since we don't work the next day to which he said he was for sure going to work and going back on his word yet again. He said he doesn't feel comfortable not going to work on our anniversary (sunday) but he would want to do something the next day EVEN THOUGH HE STILL IS SCHEDULED. So you'll call out but just not that day? Attached pic is what I was met with. Please help me because this is another promise he hasn't kept and other promises he doesn't keep or leaves them until the last second and then guilt trips me. I need advice \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nBoyfriend promised to have anniversary plans. Tried to go back on it, said nevermind and he understood me, and then actually did cancel. Said he didn't feel comfortable calling out of work on that day but would call out the next day and he requested new years day off when he could have easily requested our day off instead or as well. He has a history of being wishy washy when it comes to his word and we have a 17 year age gap so I am left conflicted. ",

        "Body": "I (21f) love my mom (45f) but there have been times where she has embarrassed me. My dad (49m) and I are American and very modern. My mom is an Italian woman who got US citizenship and she has some very old-school ways. She treats herself like maid, especially when guests come over. \n\nLast Saturday, my boyfriend (22m) came over for dinner with my parents. His 1st time meeting them. Even though my mom has a head cold, she did her usual thing. She spend hours cleaning an already clean house and then spend hours cooking a massive dinner that nobody can finish. \n\nWhen my boyfriend came over, my mom hugged and kissed him on both cheeks. She does that with everyone. She served dinner. She dominated the conversation. She was her usual self. My boyfriend was acting like a lovesick puppy. When we were alone, I sniped at him. \n\nI complained to my friends. My friend group is a mixture of people I met in high school and people I met in college. Both male and female friends. The guys surprised me as they all sympathized with my boyfriend. They explained that they all had a crush on my mom at some point, that it was almost like a rite of passage for our little group. They talked about how my mom is \"super sexy\" but I have nothing to worry about. That having a crush on my mom is almost like having a crush on a celebrity, she's unattendable.\n\nI was expecting my girl friends to rain in the horndogs and back me up but they basically agreed that it was no big deal. Of course, none of them wants their guy to crush on their mom but they all agreed that it wasn't a major relationship problem. \n\nI feel so out-of-the-loop. Apparently my mom is \"super sexy\" and everyone knows it. I'm a little annoyed at my friends as they obviously had conversations about my family behind my back, but do they have a point.

He continued to try to call me and text me, I would only respond sporadically through text to leave me alone. \n\nA few weeks later he told me during that manic week, he did in fact take the job and was still planning to move here to try to prove how much I meant to him and win me back even when I told him to stay home. He did come back, he moved in with a \u201cfriend\u201d who lives 6 minutes down the street.\n\nFor the last few months he\u2019s continued to try to contact me. I made the mistake of meeting up with him once, in public at a park, to \u201cfind closure\u201d because I stupidly thought that would help/work.\n\nSince that day, almost two months ago, I\u2019ve blocked over 5 numbers (which I figured out he can keep creating with an app) and 2 emails (which I learn only go to my spam folder).

Now he\u2019s texting me from another new number, he just \u201cwants to talk\u201d, I know that\u2019s not a good idea.. \n\nUnfortunately he knows where I live, but I moved upstairs, installed a ring camera and have two exits to \u201cescape\u201d from if needed. I don\u2019t want to be ignorant in thinking he won\u2019t hurt me, I don\u2019t think he will, he\u2019s never been violent, his word are his weapons..

        "Body": "So for some added context I work as a custodian/janitor at a hospital on 1st shift, V has never liked me or the entire 1st shift crew. She's known for being extremely rude to those on her own shift, enough to make several people quit. She will walk into the office, and make backhanded comments about how it smells bad, or nobody must've done work today since theres rooms written on the board. She has slammed the office door mere inches behind me as Ive walked out of the office. For weeks she would come to departments we'd be working in just to mess with garbage carts, or equally infuriating, she'd stand at the end of a hallway and just absolutely glare at me. I have brought up the off the clock shenanigans, as well as not being comfortable with the way she acts around me or treats me. Absolutely nothing happens to her, she's continued her comments when she walks in to the office. Ive put up with it as I've come to the conclusion there is no point telling my boss as it's never worked in the past. \nI am a hat dude, I tend to always cover my head. I am also Jewish, not super Orthodox by any means, but while working here, I used to wear a baseball cap to keep chemicals away from my scalp. I dont go around talking about religion with people as that's their own business, and I tend to keep mine personal as I had some upsetting moments involving others knowing my religious background in the past. Well, somebody \"anonymously\" complained about the hats at work, claiming they looked unprofessional, so one day it said \"No hats as per policy\" on the board in the office. Now I've read the policy and never saw anything to that order, but that's not my battle to fight in the grand scheme of things. Due to that, I o stopped wearing a baseball cap and started wearing my yarmulke (kippah) to work instead. I've worked here for a few years now so I felt comfortable enough to wear it around my coworkers. Boss is fine with it as he recognizes it's religious, not had an issue with it at all. \n\nThe other day, V walks in, makes comments about how it smells so bad in the office, a coworker was showing me something on their phone, and V just walks between her and I like we weren't there. My coworker and I ignored her, then left the office. While leaving the office, I got to hear V telling one of her coworkers  who I will refer to as Kelly,(who is actually quite a nice individual)  \"That's just stupid. That hat is stupid\" I started to walk away faster as I did not want to be around that, I even heard Kelly tell V it was a religious thing, and V doubled down saying it was stupid. I didnt hear much more after that as my hearing isn't great and I was making distance. I messaged my Boss, immediately after the fact as he had just walked in shortly after I heard this interaction. The images show the following texts between my boss and I.\n\nIt seems no matter what he seems to defend her, she never stopped glaring at me or making comments. When she was turned in for being in our departments while she was off the clock (big no no) he told us \"Oh she's just the type she likes to get stuff ready early.\" I've not wanted to go to HR as I get along with my boss and don't want him to feel like I went over his head with stuff, but I am at my last straw. What should I do? If I was too vague or confusing please feel free to ask me to clear it up and I'll do my best. ",

Because the groom has struggled with cocaine in the past and is now clean, we were careful about who we invited. We excluded some old friends still involved with drugs to avoid temptation and out of respect for the groom and his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nWe did include one old friend, let\u2019s call him Tom, who still uses, but made it very clear that there would be zero tolerance for drug use at the party. He agreed completely.\n\nBy March, we\u2019d planned the events: golf, go-karts, bowling, and a night out with a party bus. One friend generously covered a luxury suite ($1,500), and another covered the party bus ($1,500). The remaining 10 of us (excluding the groom and the two who paid for the big items) were asked to contribute $300 each into a \u201cparty fund\u201d to cover everything else: activities, drinks, food, and a group wedding gift or refunds of leftover money. I kept everything transparent with an anonymous tracking sheet.\n\nEveryone was on board. One person couldn\u2019t afford it, and another covered his share. Most people paid early. I only had to remind a couple of people, and they paid quickly.\n\nThe only exception was Tom. Even though he was one of the first to agree to the plan, when I followed up with him two weeks ago, he acted strangely. I let him know we were collecting money and he still hadn\u2019t sent his. He replied with \u201cI\u2019ll send you your money, relax.\u201d I calmly gave him the details and said we needed final numbers by the Friday before the party.\n\nThat Friday came, and still no payment. I checked in with another friend, who advised I just tell Tom that if he wasn\u2019t contributing, he\u2019d have to pay for his own stuff. I passed that message along. In return, I got called a \u201cfuck face\u201d and a \u201cbachelor party Nazi.\u201d\n\nI want to stress: I only reached out twice, politely. Meanwhile, everyone else has been cooperative, thankful, and respectful.

        "Title": "AIO by not wanting my ex to send me random selfies??",
        "Body": "So, this argument happened months ago at this point, but it's been pretty consistently bugging me since then, so I need to know if I was actually the one that was being unreasonable here. For context, me and this person had been broken up for a couple of years at this point. The relationship had been very serious and it was a pretty messy breakup, but we tried at least a few times to still be friends. At the time this argument happened, we had just started talking again after almost a year of no contact because of another, different, fight we had, and we'd only been talking again for a couple of days. In this short time span, he sent me at least three different selfies with absolutely NO context. No words, nothing meaningful that was actually worth responding to, not even an attempt to look good so it wasn't a matter of fishing for compliments. I've ALWAYS been the type to think it's ridiculous to do that, and I usually just ignore stuff like that when it gets sent to me and most people get the hint and stop doing that, but I knew that he wasn't going to stop unless I actually said something about it because he does that sort of thing so frequently. As you can see in the first screenshot, he did it to me TWICE in the span of only one hour, and I know that he did it at least one more time before those screenshots.\nThe reason this has been bothering me for so long is because I sent the screenshots to a few different friends at the time to get their opinions, and while most of them were very much on my side, ONE of them asked me why the hell I'm even talking to him on Snapchat if I DON'T want to get random selfies, and said that that's how most people use Snapchat and it shouldn't be such a big deal to me. I only even use Snapchat because it's what so many of my friends prefer for some godawful reason, but most of my friends know that I don't like being spammed with unnecessary selfies and don't send me anything unless they have something worthwhile to say, and I feel like he should be able to understand if I just don't want to see that sort of thing. It's not like me seeing his face was horribly upsetting to me or anything because I'm over the relationship entirely and there aren't any lingering romantic feelings, but now that I'm not madly and hopelessly in love with him, I just don't find it cute and adorable anymore when he does that sort of thing. When we were IN the relationship, my response to his random nonsensical selfies was always \"awww look at him being all adorable and looking for attention\" but after the breakup, all I can think about is \"okay? What exactly do you expect me to do with this? You've given me NOTHING to respond to and made me stop what I was doing and waste my time just to look at.... Your face? For no reason??\" And of course I've never actually said that because I'm not THAT much of a bitch, but I can't help feeling that way. So, am I the one that's overreacting here??",

        "Body": "I\u2019ve been dating this guy I\u2019ve known for years. We\u2019re both 30. I got out of my only relationship about five years ago, then had a bad accident three years ago that needed foot surgery. I basically stopped dating until recently. I lost a lot of support from people during that time, but he was always just kind of there, maybe because his parents still live near mine.\n\nLately he\u2019s been doing something that really bothers me. He keeps bringing up his female friends and their babies, always baby girls. He\u2019ll randomly text me about them, send pictures of the babies or even ultrasound photos, and bring them up in conversations that have nothing to do with it. The one that really throws me off is a friend from grad school (I\u2019ve never met) who had a baby girl three months ago. She hasn\u2019t even let him visit yet, but he talks about her and the baby like he\u2019s part of their family. It makes me uncomfortable FOR her and the baby and I\u2019m not sure if she even knows that he\u2019s sharing her ultrasound photos with people she doesn\u2019t know. \n\nLast weekend we went out for breakfast and he couldn\u2019t stop talking about how important his job is. He was checking his phone the whole time on a Sunday and bragging about volunteering to work weekends for an extra $150 to $200. When I asked if he\u2019s a workaholic he said yes. He\u2019s a PA, not a doctor, but the way he talks about himself feels strange. I\u2019m not even going to mention him getting two different Broadway tix for himself rather than getting two for the same show for the both of us (mentioned in this text). \n\nAm I overreacting for feeling weird about how invested he is in these women and their babies, or would this make other people uncomfortable too?",

        "Body": "Me (28M), and My girlfriend (28F) and I recently moved into our first home together, and I\u2019ve been trying to set healthy boundaries with my mum \u2014 which has been difficult because she\u2019s always had a habit of being quite controlling. She often drops by unannounced or makes decisions without asking us, and when I try to communicate openly, she tends to take it personally or twist it.\n\nA recent situation tipped things over:  \nWe mentioned we were looking at getting a specific type of shed (a Keter one), but without asking or showing us a link, my mum bought one herself and told me she\u2019d be bringing it up and setting it up on Saturday.\n\nI replied saying I hadn\u2019t seen it, and reminded her we were already looking for a specific kind. She then sent a string of messages (screenshot attached) calling me ungrateful, saying I\u2019ve become a snob, and that they won\u2019t be coming to our home anymore. She also blocked me.\n\nFor context, she often tries to blame my girlfriend for any decision I make, as if I\u2019m not capable of making choices for myself. My girlfriend has never been rude and is always grateful for anything we\u2019re given \u2014 but somehow she always becomes the scapegoat.\n\nI replied politely, telling my mum I appreciated the gesture and that she\u2019s always welcome \u2014 but I\u2019m now left feeling anxious and second-guessing myself.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this isn't even scratching the surface. When we moved house, my mum wasn't best pleased. It's a nice house in a sought after area, but when my mum saw the floorplan and the dimensions of the house, she said to my brother, who told me, that \"you couldn't even swing a cat in it\". God, I'd love to make a thread of all things she's said that have been hurtful over this past year.\n\nOh another one, when I was living with my parents, there was a time when my younger brother's girlfriends dog unexpectedly died. I was sympathetic towards her but because I didn't give her a hug (which wasn't appropriate at the time), my mum flipped because of this and kicked us both out of the house and I stayed in a hotel for a week because I didn't have a place to stay. She didn't invite me back. She packed two suitcases full of my belongings and I had to find a place to live. Me and my girlfriend were doing long distance at the time (approx 2hr drive), and because of work commitments, staying at hers wasn't an option, even though her and her family did offer.\n\nAm I overreacting for being upset by all this? Or is this kind of behaviour not okay?",

        "Body": "AIO - just a little background info. My fiance and I both work full time and we have 2 boys. I was out of work for a couple of months due to a medical issue stemming from a chronic autoimmune disease. I'm back to work now (I'm an exterminator) but we are desperately trying to get caught up on bills. Needless to say, money is extremely tight. I have less than $20 until payday and he's not much better off. Yesterday afternoon, I ended up getting a couple of extra appointments on my schedule, which is readily took as it earns me more on my paycheck, but I was working well over an hour from home. \nWith money being so tight, I frequently skip meals. Sometimes that's several days in a row. I've lost 18lbs in recent weeks. My fiance knows this and hates it, but I will always make sure my kids are fed before I am. I sent him a text asking if he would figure out supper for the family last night as I would be very late getting home and didn't want to 1) have the kids waiting on me to get home and make supper so late and 2) just really didn't want to cook after working an 11 hour shift in +90\u00b0 heat. He didn't respond to my message, so I rushed through work to hurry home and make supper so we weren't stuck eating after 8pm. This is the message I received back. I dont have the money to buy myself meals and he knows this. We don't have very much fast/quick stuff in the house, so I would have had to cook something. I figured I would just have a sandwich, too, but got home and found he had eaten 3 sandwiches which left me without bread. I ended up not eating at all yesterday and just went to bed early. I'm upset because to me, it felt like it didn't matter to him if I had food or not. It felt like I didn't matter and like he didn't think of or care about my wellbeing. I don't know if this was sheer laziness. He was playing COD when I arrived, so maybe he didn't want to cook because it would take away time from his game. I cried myself to sleep last night because I felt so abandoned in the moment. Idk why it hit me so hard, but it did. So AIO? ",

I posted in the few moments before I left for work and am finally home and able to read through more thoroughly. To add to the shitty day, a customer left her dog out and it attacked. I'm good - just a few punctures and what will undoubtedly be one hell of a bruise. My day grew nearly 2 hours longer due to the mandatory urgent care visit, paperwork, and unfortunately a police report per state laws. I'm exhausted, to say the least. With what little time I had between appointments, I did try to acknowledge and reply to a handful of comments and DMs. Let me first say that I am beyond grateful for so many kind words and actions from so many of you. Reddit can have days where it seems to be a cesspool, no matter what communities you're following, but yall all proved just how amazing this site and humanity can be. For that, I am eternally grateful. \nSecond, I hear you. The way my fiance treated me last night (and honestly in some other cases recently) isn't right. It's not the kindness and love a fiance should show, no matter how badly we're stressed. I see that now. I've done a lot of thinking and reflecting through your comments and I know I have some more to do. I don't know how this relationship will end up, but I know that in it's current state, we will not make it. I shoulder some responsibility here, too. Im definitely not a completely innocent party. I know I've made mistakes, too. With that said, allowing me to go hungry - not just today, but over the last several weeks - is 100% unacceptable and horrific. I don't deserve that, especially with as hard as I work both inside and outside the home. As so many of you pointed out, I should not be allowing him to disrespect me in any way. I escaped a violently abusive marriage nearly a decade ago. I didn't do all that just to allow mistreatment by another man. But somewhere along the road, I lost the backbone that got me out and somewhere safe.\nMy fiance and I have a lot to talk about. I know I'm not fully ready for that tonight - mostly because I'm just exhausted - but that conversation will happen before the weekend is over. \nI did reach out to him today about last night. I sent him a text and explained in no uncertain terms how worthless he made me feel in that moment. He apologized and told me he loved me. Better, I came home to both a home-cooked meal and dessert, ready and waiting for me. He asked me about my day and how I'm feeling. He hugged me long and warmly. It made me miss him and who we were even more, but it felt good to be in his arms. I told him so. It's peaceful with the kids and I'll likely take my meds and head to bed shortly. \nI very sincerely thank each of you for taking a few minutes from your own busy and stressful lives to read, comment, and message. It means so much to me that you shared those little moments with me. Thank you, from the bottom of my little southern  heart. \u2763\ufe0f",

        "Body": "For context, my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year. When we first got together, we went to the gym frequently, but over time that tapered off. These days, I go alone, which I don\u2019t mind since it helps me clear my head. However, recently, he mentioned wanting to do more things together, so we made some plans. Later, I brought up how I\u2019d love to go to the gym together again\u2014not all the time, just once or twice a week. He has a lot of free time on weekdays, so I figured it was reasonable.\n\nA few days ago, we were getting ready to go to the gym together. The only issue was that he brought up that he had to meet a friend around the same time, so he was in a bit of a time crunch. This frustrated me slightly, because it felt like he couldn't prioritise something that was important to to me, but it's not a big deal as we can always go another time.\n\nSince I was ready first, I started tidying up the apartment. I noticed the kitchen sink was clogged with rice from when he washed his pot\u2014rice that had been sitting there for four or five days. I had asked him multiple times to clean it, and while he finally did the night before, he left a pile of rice in the sink. Since we\u2019ve had drainage issues before, I wanted to clear it out before we left.\n\nAt this point, I was getting irritated. He was standing next to me while I cleaned, continuing to take his time getting ready instead of helping. Then, I noticed his stuff scattered all over the kitchen. I asked if he could put it away before we left\u2014it would have only taken a few seconds. But what really pushed me over the edge was when I turned around and saw socks on the dining table.\n\nThis is a huge boundary for me. He has a habit of throwing clothes all over the place, which I\u2019ve brought up multiple times before. Seeing socks on the table where we and our guests are supposed to eat made me snap. I told him to grow up and clean up after himself. We argued. I know I could have been more thoughtful - but I've become less tolerant of this issue.\n\nDespite the tension, we left together and took two buses to the gym. By this point, I was still frustrated, he asked if I'd continue being mad at him all day and he ended up sitting separately on the 2nd bus. That\u2019s when the attached messages started.\n\nTo me, it felt like he was bombarding me with messages regardless of what I said. I explained my frustration, but he kept pushing without building on what were talking about. I was really trying to get this resolved before we got off. This wasnt getting resolved. So, I bluntly texted him I needed space and just wanted to focus on working out. It seemed like he agreed to giving eachother space.\n\nWhen we got to the bus stop, I left for the gym alone since we had both agreed to take space. I knew he was meeting his friend that was close anyway, so I figured it was fine. But instead of leaving, he followed me into the gym.\n\nHe asked to use my locker, I told him directly there are other lockers with integrated locks available and he was leaving soon anyway. While I was on the treadmill, he interrupted me to ask again if I was going to be mad all day.\n\nAt this point, I was really overwhelmed. My mind was racing, and I just told him to leave me alone. That\u2019s when the gym texts started.\n\nHis messages really threw me off\u2014he was apologising one second, guilt-tripping me the next, then victimising himself, and dismissing my need for space. The wildest part was when he threatened to never go to the gym with me again and then ended with \"lmao be stressed\" after I asked once more for space. It felt claustrophobic, like I was expected to immediately regulate my emotions and act like nothing had happened\u2014 to comfort him- even though my boundaries had been repeatedly ignored.\n\nEventually, he ran a bit on the treadmill while I stretched, then he left.\n\nI finished my workout, used the sauna, and went home. I spent a few hours cooking and relaxing on my computer, trying to clear my head. Later, I decided to go for a bike ride to get some fresh air. It felt great.\n\nThen, I got a message from him: \"Woke up to see you\u2019ve left. Not a nice feeling\"\n\nAt that point, I just thought\u2014 do I really have to explain myself after everything that happened? Freedom is a big thing for me, he knows this, and it felt suffocating to be tracked like that. When I got home, I went straight to bed.\n\nI didn\u2019t hear a word from him all day. Later, I headed to the gym alone. As soon as I left the house, he flooded me with messages.\n\nI refused to engage in that cycle again. I thought, why didn\u2019t he bring this up when I was home? So I just told him we\u2019d talk after my session\u2014I didn\u2019t want to associate my gym time with negativity.\n\nI also texted (not in the screenshots) that I\u2019d let him know when I was ready to talk. Looking back, I get what he was trying to say, but completely ignoring my need for space and then demanding an apology felt like too much. I knew I needed to apologise for snapping in the kitchen, but he was hyper-fixating on what happened at the gym\u2014as if I had forced him to be there.\n\nAnother day went by. By the end of it, I started the conversation. We talked everything through, I ordered pizza, and watched a show together. He cooked some chicken for me, and it felt like things were back to normal.\n\nBut I still can\u2019t shake the weird feeling from his texts.\n\nDuring our talk, he kept pushing the narrative that I made him uncomfortable, embarrassed, and insecure at the gym\u2014but in the moment, I felt like I was under so much pressure and had no room to breathe. It felt inescapable. All I said was that I needed to be left alone, but he kept engaging with me. He also said the socks were actually clean, and 'they smelled fine' - sure... I'm just confused why he didn't just say that when I brought it up on the day. He said he was struggling while I was taking space, almost talked to me, but admitted he didn't want to be the first one to talk because then he'd be letting me 'win'? - just really strange.\n\nI didn\u2019t straight up tell him I found his messages manipulative, but I did say I was weirded out by them. Now, I\u2019m just trying to get some outside perspective.\n\nDoes this seem manipulative, or just bad communication? Whenever I needed space before, he'd become passive aggressive, sarcastic etc...

Me and this girl tho were never close and I always felt like she didn\u2019t like me but I could never give a valid reason of why I felt like that. Eventually one of the friends in the group told me that the girl told her she would never be friends with someone like me because of who I was as a person (emotional and sensitive), even though that hurt my feelings I didn\u2019t bring it up and started distancing myself from the group. After some months of not talking to anyone I left the group chats and eventually unfollowed the girl and once I did this is the reaction she gave me and before I could even respond she blocks me. I personally think it\u2019s juvenile because if she didn\u2019t like me in the first place why would it trigger her that I simply unfollowed her?

        "Body": "This is kind of an update to this post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/2FGF4pADNm\n\nTLDR: I got into an argument with my boyfriend after I went through his phone and found out he was live texting my abortion to his female friend, including sending a photo of my sonogram. \n\nAs we worked our way through that argument, I asked him to ask his friend, whose opinion he clearly values so much, how she would feel if she were essentially in my position. \n\nI asked him to text her \u201chow would you feel if you found out your boyfriend sent your  sonogram to another woman and told her about your abortion\u201d. \n\nI go back and forth between thinking this is a crazy ask and a reasonable request. I believe she is in the wrong for participating in this and not calling him out on sending sonogram photos if she is such a \u201cgirls girl\u201d. But I do feel like it\u2019s a bit crazy to ask your boyfriend to send messages. Idk. \n\nBut he agreed to it. So he said. \n\nHe sat there and pretended to send the text. \n\nInstead he sent \u201chi quick question\u201d and when she responded he reduced our argument to me being mad about him discussing our relationship with her. \n\nI had asked him several times that day what her response was. Each time \u201cshe hadn\u2019t responded\u201d. When I asked the next day he said she responded \u201chey what\u2019s up\u201d, as if she just ignored the whole thing. \n\nPart of me believed him and thought maybe she thought I took his phone and sent that text and maybe waited for a cool down period before responding. \n\nAnother part of me felt like he was lying. I felt the insincerity. I felt like he was hiding something. I swear I even had a vision of him deleting texts. \n\nSo I took his phone a few days later and immediately opened deleted messages and this is what I found. \n\nThe \u201comg you\u2019re supposed to delete\u201d and the \u201cI guess so\u201d followed by the immediate deletion of the messages. I was sent into a rage. That was it for me. \n\nI swear I\u2019m being gaslit now. He\u2019s telling me that he deleted them because he was embarrassed. Because he was mad at himself for even responding to her after telling me that he was cutting that relationship off. That is such horse shit. You deleted the messages to hide them from me. \n\nI knew I had a bad feeling about this friendship. She gives advice such as \u201cyou\u2019re supposed to delete the messages\u201d. What if someone gave her boyfriend that advice? Be so fucking forreal. Always trust your gut instinct, people. \n\nI guess I\u2019m really just looking for validation here. Because a huge part of me wants to stay knowing damn well I need to walk away. \n\n",

At first, things were good, but over time, I found out he cheated with my FRIEND, lied to me constantly, and said many hurtful things. He was emotionally closed off, never fully let me in, and didn't put in nearly as much effort as I did. I often felt unseen and like I had to constantly prove my worth. Safe to say, I loved him a lot. And at many times it felt like he took advantage of my forgiveness and kindness.\n\nDuring the breakup, we saw each other again two weeks after and I felt like I was practically begging him to give us another chance trying to convince him that I was enough, that we had something special. But he made it clear that he didn't want that. He even said I loved him more than he loved me, which really put things into perspective for me. I respected that and told him that if I stepped away, I wasn't coming back.\n\nAbout a week later, he texted me again, essentially repeating the same thing he had already said. I reflected during that week and realized I felt the same way he wasn't what I wanted, and he wasn't worth my time. I had been doing too much for someone who didn't care as much as I did. Therefore, I didn't care to change his mind anymore.\n\n\nThree weeks later (text messages shown), he sent me another message, and I responded firmly.\nI feel a little bad about it and worry I might have been too harsh, but honestly, l'm indifferent about him now. I don't care about his guilt or his attempts to tell me my worth because I already know it. It seems like he's just trying to clean his conscience and honestly it took me back be he's very avoidant about things like this.\n\nI feel like I took it too far and overreacted, usually I\u2019d be more understanding and even afterwards I felt bad bc im not usually this way.
