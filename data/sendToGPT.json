I always knew that I had to leave, but it was one of the hardest thing to do. We met when I was 18, he was 19, both in college. 2 years later we started dating, graduated together, moved in and found out about the cheating. I went through his phone because I suspect he was hiding something so this is how I found out and confirmed he only did it the first 2 months. Of course this hurt very badly since prior to dating, we were friends for 2 years. I loved him so deeply that I didn't want to let go, I held on as long as I could. I never told my friends what happened until now, I was too ashamed. And now I'm suffering the consequences of my own mistakes, I never should have taken him back. And I know a lot of you guys will criticize me but he was my first of, and I truly loved him. I thought he could change so I gave him a second chance.\nI'm 24 now, and I have a career, have friends and family that love me. Why should I waste the rest of my 20's on some guy that takes everything for granted? I think I already knew he was cheating when I posted this, but I just wanted that push that you guys gave me. Thank you.\nTruly thank you, for the harsh words, the encouragement and the compassion. To anyone that is going through something similar, take my and everyone's advice, leave.\nThey never change, they just get better at hiding it.",

        "Background": "Brief history about me. I worked at my last job for 2 years and worked my way up to management, this last year i transfered to Michigan from New Jersey and have been here since March. I got offered to work at a Car Wash and make way more money. I voiced concerns about culture difference as im super proud and happy of the culture I had at my last work place and how its a huge stepping stone for me to leave there. They reassured me and were super kind and helpful. I get hired, decide to take the opportunity and ive been here 2 and a half weeks now. \n\nToday was my last day. I started off in a management role, was trying to get to learn the team and how to do the job. I had very minimal training and taught myself a lot, there were times in my first week I was the only management on site and barely knew what was going on. I was asking questions to learn stuff, and when they got back I ran over what I did to see if it was right and they said yes. At the end of every shift they thanked me and told me I was doing great. \n\nOne day my manager texts me saying im going to be at another location a few miles away because my training is now over. My first day at the new location, he comes to the location and said come talk to me. What's been going on? I said jobs great and I love it, feel like im adapting well and learning a lot. And he says well we have an issue and that's why I moved you here. I asked what was the issue? He said the manager there didnt see any leadership from me and wasn't looking for my style of management. And that there was an incident. \n\nHOW HE HEARD THE STORY: Me, A manager, and another guy were in the booth. I brought up my past how \"back in jersey I was the token white kid grew up around black people and said the n-word\" and it made the woman manager uncomfortable so here we are.\n\nHOW THE STORY UNFOLDED: me, a manager and a WHITE guy were in the booth. He said something something n***a. He looked at me and said, im sorry, I grew up in detroit. I responded with you're okay. Ive heard it plenty when I lived in New Jersey. He said oh so you grew up in the hood? I said i wouldn't really say the hood but I was definitely one of the token white kids growing up. It was mainly black, Hispanic and middle eastern where im from. He said oh cool that's wassup. And then we got cars and dispersed.\n\nI defended myself and asked what he meant about my leadership as I felt I took on a lot for being new and was making sure shit was running and getting done as efficiently as I could and I feel like judging my work on a week worth of work isnt necessarily fair. Plus everyone knows what to do so there hasn't been any need for me to get people moving. The bell goes off and everyone disperses to do their job. There have been times im the only one around and make sure shits done. Plus every day the manager says how great ive been doing. If she doesnt tell me what im doing wrong, how can I improve? And also I never said the n-word. I was asked a question about my past and I answered it. But yes, I grew up around black people. (I didnt snitch on guy that actually said it cuz im not like that) \n\nHis response was well people would follow a man of your stature, you just have to tap into the strict side and lead with some fear. We cant have our managers too friendly with the staff and getting super personal. I moved you here to give you another chance, if you fail me again I'll demote you down to line work. Just be more conserved and dont share so much.\n\nWhich I dont even know wtf he means with the stature. But I felt like the disrespect was more towards my friends I grew up with more than towards me. Cuz I also noticed after this convo I have only worked with white people in management. \n\nSo I said, Okay. You got it. Apologies. Won't let it happen again. So now at this new gig all i did is talk work and if anyone asked anything personal I gave half assed dry responses.\n\nToday I get to work and the new manager im working with hands me a line worker shirt and said to wear that instead of my production super shirt. I said why? He said Manager said he talked to you yesterday did he not? I said no he didnt and he said oh well he didnt really give me a reason why but told me to give you a line worker shirt because you got demoted. I talked to him on the phone and asked what about the second opportunity? He says the opportunity was that he didnt fire me and im still able to work for the company.

        "Background": "My boyfriend (M23) quit his job about 2 months ago due to the toxicity of the work place, being overworked, and underpaid. He didn\u2019t have a different job lined up and has been jobless ever since. The first month he was pretty depressed about it and took time to rest, relax, destress, sleep and cope so he wasn\u2019t searching for a new job which I totally understand. However the second month is almost over and he is still jobless. He was offered a job for a brand new place in August, but that\u2019s months away and he has no money or savings\u00a0 my at all right NOW. He complains about how he has no money for anything, not for food, not for rent, not for gifts or dinner for our anniversary in a couple of days, but is being picky about finding a temporary job until August. He only is looking for opening at spots that he is familiar with and that have to do with his occupation and has barely put any effort into looking at those places. I understand he WANTS to stay in the this specific industry even as a temporary job, but he NEEDS money and as a responsible adult he should be able to put his ego aside and sacrifice his wants for his needs, getting a quick easy temporary job isn\u2019t hard there are soooo many listings and even if it\u2019s a job he doesn\u2019t want to do it\u2019s TEMPORARY because he needs money NOW! He says that it\u2019s too late to even get a temporary job because rent is due in a week and he won\u2019t get a paycheck from a new job in time which is true BUT ITLL GET HIM MONEY IN THE FUTURE. Idk how to help him or what to do now. Am I being an asshole? I\u2019m just trying to help.",

        "Background": "So i  had this friend, whom i talked to for a year, because we played same games and shared interests but because he started joking offensive gay jokes and mocking me. i was fed up w him i decided to end friendship because he didnt acknowledge my frustration or try to understand why i was hurt.  it didnt help so i blocked him. Week after week i received texts from his alt accounts, he usually pretended to be someone else but i kept blocking. \nSo 1 month after he went quiet so i thought he moved on but tonight i received another friend request and he pretended to be buyer for my game account ? I posted an AD on reddit, but i never gave him my reddit profile ?? I was genuinly scared today when he revealed himself\n\nHe doest live in my area, but this is horrible feeling of being traced online ?? \n\nI dont undersrand what he wants from me, is he just lonely or weirdo. Why he would be a friend with someone who he judges and dont approve their lifestyle ?",
