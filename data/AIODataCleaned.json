I always knew that I had to leave, but it was one of the hardest thing to do. We met when I was 18, he was 19, both in college. 2 years later we started dating, graduated together, moved in and found out about the cheating. I went through his phone because I suspect he was hiding something so this is how I found out and confirmed he only did it the first 2 months. Of course this hurt very badly since prior to dating, we were friends for 2 years. I loved him so deeply that I didn't want to let go, I held on as long as I could. I never told my friends what happened until now, I was too ashamed. And now I'm suffering the consequences of my own mistakes, I never should have taken him back. And I know a lot of you guys will criticize me but he was my first of, and I truly loved him. I thought he could change so I gave him a second chance.\nI'm 24 now, and I have a career, have friends and family that love me. Why should I waste the rest of my 20's on some guy that takes everything for granted? I think I already knew he was cheating when I posted this, but I just wanted that push that you guys gave me. Thank you.\nTruly thank you, for the harsh words, the encouragement and the compassion. To anyone that is going through something similar, take my and everyone's advice, leave.\nThey never change, they just get better at hiding it.",

        "Background": "Brief history about me. I worked at my last job for 2 years and worked my way up to management, this last year i transfered to Michigan from New Jersey and have been here since March. I got offered to work at a Car Wash and make way more money. I voiced concerns about culture difference as im super proud and happy of the culture I had at my last work place and how its a huge stepping stone for me to leave there. They reassured me and were super kind and helpful. I get hired, decide to take the opportunity and ive been here 2 and a half weeks now. \n\nToday was my last day. I started off in a management role, was trying to get to learn the team and how to do the job. I had very minimal training and taught myself a lot, there were times in my first week I was the only management on site and barely knew what was going on. I was asking questions to learn stuff, and when they got back I ran over what I did to see if it was right and they said yes. At the end of every shift they thanked me and told me I was doing great. \n\nOne day my manager texts me saying im going to be at another location a few miles away because my training is now over. My first day at the new location, he comes to the location and said come talk to me. What's been going on? I said jobs great and I love it, feel like im adapting well and learning a lot. And he says well we have an issue and that's why I moved you here. I asked what was the issue? He said the manager there didnt see any leadership from me and wasn't looking for my style of management. And that there was an incident. \n\nHOW HE HEARD THE STORY: Me, A manager, and another guy were in the booth. I brought up my past how \"back in jersey I was the token white kid grew up around black people and said the n-word\" and it made the woman manager uncomfortable so here we are.\n\nHOW THE STORY UNFOLDED: me, a manager and a WHITE guy were in the booth. He said something something n***a. He looked at me and said, im sorry, I grew up in detroit. I responded with you're okay. Ive heard it plenty when I lived in New Jersey. He said oh so you grew up in the hood? I said i wouldn't really say the hood but I was definitely one of the token white kids growing up. It was mainly black, Hispanic and middle eastern where im from. He said oh cool that's wassup. And then we got cars and dispersed.\n\nI defended myself and asked what he meant about my leadership as I felt I took on a lot for being new and was making sure shit was running and getting done as efficiently as I could and I feel like judging my work on a week worth of work isnt necessarily fair. Plus everyone knows what to do so there hasn't been any need for me to get people moving. The bell goes off and everyone disperses to do their job. There have been times im the only one around and make sure shits done. Plus every day the manager says how great ive been doing. If she doesnt tell me what im doing wrong, how can I improve? And also I never said the n-word. I was asked a question about my past and I answered it. But yes, I grew up around black people. (I didnt snitch on guy that actually said it cuz im not like that) \n\nHis response was well people would follow a man of your stature, you just have to tap into the strict side and lead with some fear. We cant have our managers too friendly with the staff and getting super personal. I moved you here to give you another chance, if you fail me again I'll demote you down to line work. Just be more conserved and dont share so much.\n\nWhich I dont even know wtf he means with the stature. But I felt like the disrespect was more towards my friends I grew up with more than towards me. Cuz I also noticed after this convo I have only worked with white people in management. \n\nSo I said, Okay. You got it. Apologies. Won't let it happen again. So now at this new gig all i did is talk work and if anyone asked anything personal I gave half assed dry responses.\n\nToday I get to work and the new manager im working with hands me a line worker shirt and said to wear that instead of my production super shirt. I said why? He said Manager said he talked to you yesterday did he not? I said no he didnt and he said oh well he didnt really give me a reason why but told me to give you a line worker shirt because you got demoted. I talked to him on the phone and asked what about the second opportunity? He says the opportunity was that he didnt fire me and im still able to work for the company.

        "Background": "My boyfriend (M23) quit his job about 2 months ago due to the toxicity of the work place, being overworked, and underpaid. He didn\u2019t have a different job lined up and has been jobless ever since. The first month he was pretty depressed about it and took time to rest, relax, destress, sleep and cope so he wasn\u2019t searching for a new job which I totally understand. However the second month is almost over and he is still jobless. He was offered a job for a brand new place in August, but that\u2019s months away and he has no money or savings\u00a0 my at all right NOW. He complains about how he has no money for anything, not for food, not for rent, not for gifts or dinner for our anniversary in a couple of days, but is being picky about finding a temporary job until August. He only is looking for opening at spots that he is familiar with and that have to do with his occupation and has barely put any effort into looking at those places. I understand he WANTS to stay in the this specific industry even as a temporary job, but he NEEDS money and as a responsible adult he should be able to put his ego aside and sacrifice his wants for his needs, getting a quick easy temporary job isn\u2019t hard there are soooo many listings and even if it\u2019s a job he doesn\u2019t want to do it\u2019s TEMPORARY because he needs money NOW! He says that it\u2019s too late to even get a temporary job because rent is due in a week and he won\u2019t get a paycheck from a new job in time which is true BUT ITLL GET HIM MONEY IN THE FUTURE. Idk how to help him or what to do now. Am I being an asshole? I\u2019m just trying to help.",

        "Background": "I\u2019ve (32F) been best friends with my friend T (29F) since 2022. We used to hang out at least 2-3 times a month and have never had any bad blood or arguments that I know of from my end. She does have BPD and have had crazy, angry outbursts in the past. Her most recent one was in January where she lashed out at our other \nfriend C (29F) in which C cut us both off because she thought I was taking T\u2019s side. This was during my birthday in January. Before I had the chance to touch base with C, I realized that she had blocked me on social media. \n\nIn January, T told me she was studying for a really important entrance exam, that she is taking in the fall, and that she wasn\u2019t going to be available as she works two days a week and will be studying four days a week. She said she reserved Fridays for herself or with friends. I said no problem and have texted her multiple times in which she either said she couldn\u2019t it canceled the day of. We finally had the time to meet and for lunch in April. Since then, I\u2019ve made attempts and reached out to her about hanging out or just talking on the phone in which she declined and said she was busy.\n\nT\u2019s 30th birthday is in two weeks so I texted her asking to hang out. I totally understand her not being available for her birthday but it was the \u201cactually follow through\u201d part that confuses me because I have only canceled on her once. Now that I look back and reflect, I was always tiptoeing around her and doing the things she wanted. For example, if I wanted a girls night in and she wanted to go out, we would go out. If I wanted to eat here but she wanted to eat then we would eat there. It seems like she doesn\u2019t want to be my friend which is totally okay but I could be overthinking things. I was unfortunately involved in a very abusive romantic relationship in 2024 so I now question everything and am in therapy for it.\n\nThank you!",

        "Background": "For context I have been in my step brothers life since he was 5 and I was 13. Mark was always the golden child, never getting in trouble or really facing consequences for his actions. His family treated him better than me and my sibilings while my family treated him as one of us, thus causing him to act like he was better than me or my brother who is 2 years older than him. Then as a teenager he started dating a girl and they ended up having 2 kids after high school.\n\nSo I'll start when my brothers (we will call him Mark)  at the time, fiancee (we will call her Sarah) was pregnant he broke up with her, or cheated on her according to her (found out later she is a huge pathological liar, but so is Mark) and started dating some girl from Ohio. We live in Upper Michigan and he was working on a freighter at the time. The girl broke up with him after about a month and mark got off the boats to \"figure his life out\". During this time they were also living in a home owned by my parents and were supposed to be paying rent but Sarah was not working and so they were not paying my parents rent. Then right before their 2nd child was born he went back out on the boats.During this time they were also living in a home owned by my parents and were supposed to be paying rent but Sarah was not working and so they were not paying my parents rent. Then right before their 2nd child was born he went back out on the boats, and also was sent to Seattle for special training paid for by his company.\n\nDuring all of this Mark was telling my mother that he was working on his relationship with Sarah and that they were going to get married. According to Sarah he was also telling her she needed to go to therapy to make things work between them. Then in January of 2024 we found out Mark, who was almost 23 at the time, had been talking to and seeing a 18 year old girl from Ohio for 3 months (who we will call Darlene.) I will admit when I found out I sent him some rather nasty texts and called Darlene some rather nasty names that I did not mean it was just to make Mark mad, and I regret that now and have since apologized. . Mark during this time had been living with Sarah due to it being the off season for the Lakes and freighters. But again was jot paying rent since he never applied for off season unemployment. Mark then left to move to Ohio to be with Darlene and live with her and her parents. He did go back out on the freighter for ~ 2 weeks but then left due to his \"mental health\". \n\nIn May I got fired from my job and moved back to the town my parents were living and moved in with Darlene. I lived with her for almost 2 months before moving out due to her lying stiring up drama between me, my mother and her mother, and also her being a TERRIBLE mother who was giving my 3 year old nephew melatonin each night to get him to sleep and didn't really bathe the kids and sat on her phone all day while I took care of the kids. My nephew even started calling me mama during this time because I was taking care of them more than she was, which mad her upset causing more drama. She also during this time started letting mormons come into our house because she wanted to start dating the cute 20 year old mormon, but honestly what guy that age would want to be with a 25 year old single mother of 2? \n\nI moved out and managed to patch things up with Mark due to finding out how crazy Sarah was. But for context Mark never told us any of the stuff that happened between him and Sarah. He has always hid stuff from us because he doesn't want to take accountability for his actions. Then for the kids birthday he came up with Darlene to see them. He was late and refused to see any of us because of Darlenes \"anxiety\". I let Mark know how I felt he had ruined mine and my mother's time with the kids as after my falling out with Sarah she kept the kids away from my parents and also was accusing me of stealing in front of my nephew (I know this because he yelled at me to give his mom her stuff back) I never stole anything from her. In fact when she finally moved put of my parents house, owing them thousands in back rent she stole things of theirs. Including a microwave that my grandparents had bought for my parents as a gift. While Sarah moved out she also took all of Mark's stuff as well. Stealing it from us as Mark had told us we could keep it, such as a mini fridge and a big screen TV that his mother had bought him for his birthday. But we found out after, without Mark informing us, that he had caved and told Sarah she could take it as she had been poking and yelling at him that she should take it for his kids.\n\nAfter letting Mark know how I felt hurt by him making me leave and wouldn't even get out of the car to tell me himself and made Sarah tell me he didn't really communicate. Then right before Christmas of 2024 him and Darlene came to visit. I had just gotten home from work and walked through the door to see Darlene and Mark sitting at the dining room table still in their hats and coats. I said hi to Mark and he did not introduce me to Darlene. I went about talking with my family. When my brother came home and his uncle had called to video chat with my step dad they both made fun of the hat Mark was wearing. I could tell this upset Darlene as we knew Darlene had dressed Mark up as he was wearing stuff he never wore before or would have chosen himself. Darlene then was ready to leave, Mark and her were going to leave without even talking to my mother as she was getting ready because they stopped by way earlier than any of us expected. Mark then told us he was going to come back to visit later. This did not happen as he made Sarah and the kids leave our house to see him and Darlene as he did not want to come over to \"prevent drama\". I don't know what drama he was talking about as I thought the visit went fine despite Darlene and Mark not leaving the dining room table.\n\nAfter that Mark did not talk to us. Then on March 7th I sent Mark a text (will include photo) telling him that him and Darlene need to be careful when on the phone with Sarah because the kids can hear and I was told by my nephew Darlene was yelling at Sarah. I told him that I understand it's hard with Sarah as she pokes trying to get a reaction out of people to feed her need of drama, and I was currently not talking to her even when she came to visit. Mark then went off on me saying we make Darlene out to be the villain when shes not and basically telling me me and our parents are terrible people as we did not give Darlene a chance and talk bad about her. I informed him we do not talk about Darlene as we do not know her, have met her only once, and that I was just trying to help. I ended our long back and forth apologizing for anything I may have done wrong and said \"I don't know how to fix this situation.\" He has not called or sent me a text since.\n\nAfter that they came to visit for Easter. I did not see Darlene or Mark but they stopped by my parents house when my step dad was working on the other house and Darlene chose that time to yell at my mother telling her we have not been there for Mark or supported him. That she is the only one who has been there for him. I don't understand how we can support Mark when he doesn't talk to us and lives 7 hours away but ok pop off sis \ud83d\ude44. My mom then explained to Mark that I didn't mean any harm from my text and was just  trying to help and he told her that it's didn't come off that way.\n\nThen during the summer Sarah had to deal with CPS twice as my nephew had run away and my nieces feet had somehow gotten severely burnt while she was at work and the kids were at the babysitters. We were not in contact with Mark at this point and my Step dad had been working to keep the kids in our lives as we did not want Sarah keeping them from us as she had done multiple times at this point whenever she was mad at us.about a month later when Mark was notified by CPS he called his father and yelled at him asking why he didn't tell him about CPS. Which his father let him know the reasons I gave up above. Mark then cut communication with his father pretty much completely at that point.\n\nMost recent incident was at my neice and nephews birthday party. My mother was helping my nephew open gifts and he didn't seem interested in his gift from his aunt. To which my mother jokingly said \"I guess we will have to throw it out then.\" This upset his aunt but everything was talked through and it ended up fine. After that something upset Sarah (unsure what) so she told Mark about it. He then called my mother yelling at her telling her she is nothing to those kids and her and his father did this stuff to him growing up and she is not to do it to his kids. He did not specify what things they did to him but then went on to say he is afraid to talk to my parents, didn't say why, and that he is hurt from this division (my words not his). He then aslo said he is used to being number 1 and he is number 2 because we put his kids first and he doesn't like that. I was listening in during that part and had to stifle my laughs. \n\nI also recently found out that him and Darlene are getting married next July and we are not invited. I know this from post and reposts online she is doing basically bragging about how we are not invited, such as one post where she was talking about the wedding and how they are so excited for family to be there. We'll we won't be, we weren't planning on going even if invited. Mark also doesn't know how his extended family feels either.",

My boyfriend called his mom the c word because she made a note on her door that said only me and her husband can be in her house . He has a history of being extremely irritable and irrational if he doesn\u2019t agree with something she says . Very easily argumentative too. He called her this to ME not to her after I brought her home from having breast cancer surgery. The audacity ! Is all I could think about. Prior to this he had shown me a screen shot he had taken of his ex girlfriend that he had found when we were cleaning out his attic that he had said he put in his deletion folder on his phone . He told me this after i told him about some guys who while I was working told me they wanted to pull me into their car from the drive Through window of my work . He justified that by saying you shouldn\u2019t tell me about men flirting with you . I wasn\u2019t flirting , and they said it and all of my coworkers on headsets also heard it . He said he also deleted the photo upon taking it and reversed the deletion on his phone . I am 100 percent convinced he wouldn\u2019t have told me if I hadn\u2019t of told him about those guys being creepy and embarrassing as f. So with a long history between us of him calling me names and making me cry often and him telling me he does it because I make him , I decided since he did that guilt free and called his mom the c word after breast cancer surgery , I decided I would guilt freely take his revolver and sell it to a local pawn shop. I lied when he asked why it was missing for a couple days then came clean and went to turn myself in as I really didn\u2019t consider the repercussions of selling a gun that isn\u2019t yours . But for justice for his mom\u2019s respect.  He made a report on the missing gun after I came clean about what I did . Am I in the wrong ? I wanna know your opinions . And now I\u2019m facing prison time and waiting the the detectives to contact both of us to hear each side of our stories . He\u2019s calling me a criminal And a thief and demanding I pay him back for the gun . Thank you. My life is a mess right now to say the least . I wish I could say I was kidding . ",

No comfort just dead silence and I kept asking him if he was there and he just didn't answer beyond \"I'm just focusing on my game\" while I was crying about being in pain and scared about going to the doctors. \n\nI got off the phone and I, I admit i was very upset and distraught because I was extremely sleep deprived, stressed, and my sickness had progressed really bad so yesterday I was crying and called my mom who I was no contact with to drive me to urgent care in another city.

He closed his discord and didn't talk to me again for hours until really late at night and hasn't seemed concerned at all or supportive in the slightest.

        "Background": "I was molested/raped as a child between the ages of 7-13 years old by my stepfather. My mom remarried when I was about 5 years old. I didn't tell my mom until I was an adult (22 years old), because my mom and I never had a good relationship. She was very physically abusive my entire life. She also was sexually abused most of her childhood, but it was by her biological father and her mom (my grandma) did nothing about it. It happened to my aunt as well. It also happened to my grandma when she was a child - so this is messed up generational trauma that never ended. The main reason I also waited to tell was because I knew my mom relied on my stepdad for finances and he would throw that in my face all the time that we would be sleeping on the street without him and how would we afford our fancy private schools etc... but I mainly didn't tell because of my little brother that is his biological son. I never wanted to ruin their relationship because they were so close. However, I did eventually tell when I was about 22 years old and he admitted it. My mom went nuts; but ultimately stayed with him - like I knew she would. \n\nAnyway, my fiance knows everything about me we have been together for 9 years but things haven't been good. We fight all the time now and just don't have a good time when we are together. One day out of nowhere; he randomly started talking about how children that were sexually abused become abusers or desensitized to abuse because of what happened to them. I know this already, but then he started asking me as if he thinks I would be like my mother since i didn't cut her out and allow that. Or asking how I would react and imply that I probably would cave if I was actually in the situation even though I don't want it and feel so strongly against it. And after telling him no and asking how he could feel that way it started a big fight. I ended up blocking him and this was one of the convos we had right after on a text now number he messaged me from. \n\nI am very paranoid about these things. So after 9 years of being with him, even though I never felt this way before but the real reason I was turned off was because in my head I was wondering secretly and sadly if he would ever do something like that and is testing the waters with me. We don't have kids yet, and I'm probably wrong to jump to that because nothing has happened like this before.. but after everything I been through I tend to always think the worst. Do you think I can be right ? Or was he just really wondering how I felt bc of what happened to me \n\nI hope the messages are in the right order - and I have the others as well how it started. ",

So i was awake and i noticed he was online on ig so i texted him asking him why he\u2019s awake and if she\u2019s okay, and he starts responding to me like this, yeah i mean its late for me to be awake but i slept a lot earlier so im not tired. Anyway im asking because I feel bad now I feel like I didn\u2019t reassure him enough and im sad i let him go to back sleep angry. I get he fears I\u2019ll cheat but i dont think ive ever given him a reason. I feel like this comes from his previous relationship but im really trying to heal whatever happened to cause him to act this way but it doesn\u2019t seem to work. Idk did i not reassure him enough? Also he says i got out a lot but he knows the only times i go out is with my 2 friends and i always make sure to turn on my location and he even has my friends addresses which they don\u2019t mind because they know it\u2019s for him to make sure im at their houses and he FaceTimes me sometimes when im out so im not sure if I should stay home like he wants too. Am i not doing enough?\n\n\nEdit: also thank you all for the concern i appreciate it so much and I see people saying something about me getting hit but I won\u2019t even give him the chance btw he\u2019s scared of my dad idk why so for those concerned about my safety I will definitely tell my dad about this behavior because he has no idea he is acting this way but thank you for the concern and the advice:) \n\nEdit#2: I am going to leave him. Working on it since he is still asleep rn ..\n\n\ud835\udc14\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc04:sorry this update took hours but I did it. I broke up with him.Thanks to these comments and the support I was not surprised to how he reacted,cussing, calling me out of my name, and even accused me for leaving him for someone else rather than seeing I broke up with him because he\u2019s being abusive. I am hurt but not because I exited this but because my head is stuck in the past or the fake version of him where he was kind and when our relationship was great.Im emotional about it all right now but I will get over it. I also want to say Thank you all so much for the support the comments the advice as well,i truly would\u2019ve never even thought to end this because in my head i had no idea this was considered abuse I just thought it was insecurity I could fix, I will be forever grateful and glad I asked on here. Thank you so much to everyone. Also the people who were straight up rude calling me an idiot and making me feel like this was my fault, please learn to be kinder it doesn\u2019t take much. Anyway sorry for the long update but since you all supported me, I owed it to you all:) I\u2019m eternally grateful for the help\u2661\ufe0e\u2661\ufe0e",

She's known for being extremely rude to those on her own shift, enough to make several people quit. She will walk into the office, and make backhanded comments about how it smells bad, or nobody must've done work today since theres rooms written on the board. She has slammed the office door mere inches behind me as Ive walked out of the office. For weeks she would come to departments we'd be working in just to mess with garbage carts, or equally infuriating, she'd stand at the end of a hallway and just absolutely glare at me. I have brought up the off the clock shenanigans, as well as not being comfortable with the way she acts around me or treats me. Absolutely nothing happens to her, she's continued her comments when she walks in to the office. Ive put up with it as I've come to the conclusion there is no point telling my boss as it's never worked in the past. \nI am a hat dude, I tend to always cover my head. I am also Jewish, not super Orthodox by any means, but while working here, I used to wear a baseball cap to keep chemicals away from my scalp. I dont go around talking about religion with people as that's their own business, and I tend to keep mine personal as I had some upsetting moments involving others knowing my religious background in the past. Well, somebody \"anonymously\" complained about the hats at work, claiming they looked unprofessional, so one day it said \"No hats as per policy\" on the board in the office. Now I've read the policy and never saw anything to that order, but that's not my battle to fight in the grand scheme of things. Due to that, I o stopped wearing a baseball cap and started wearing my yarmulke (kippah) to work instead. I've worked here for a few years now so I felt comfortable enough to wear it around my coworkers. Boss is fine with it as he recognizes it's religious, not had an issue with it at all. \n\nThe other day, V walks in, makes comments about how it smells so bad in the office, a coworker was showing me something on their phone, and V just walks between her and I like we weren't there. My coworker and I ignored her, then left the office. While leaving the office, I got to hear V telling one of her coworkers  who I will refer to as Kelly,(who is actually quite a nice individual)  \"That's just stupid. That hat is stupid\" I started to walk away faster as I did not want to be around that, I even heard Kelly tell V it was a religious thing, and V doubled down saying it was stupid. I didnt hear much more after that as my hearing isn't great and I was making distance. I messaged my Boss, immediately after the fact as he had just walked in shortly after I heard this interaction. The images show the following texts between my boss and I.\n\nIt seems no matter what he seems to defend her, she never stopped glaring at me or making comments. When she was turned in for being in our departments while she was off the clock (big no no) he told us \"Oh she's just the type she likes to get stuff ready early.\" I've not wanted to go to HR as I get along with my boss and don't want him to feel like I went over his head with stuff, but I am at my last straw. What should I do? If I was too vague or confusing please feel free to ask me to clear it up and I'll do my best. ",

He is very hard to read and i have expressed that i want to know whats going on in his mind and understand what he needs from me as his partner.\nI have been struggling with my depression for a couple months now and it took me a while to admit to him how bad it was due to past relationships not handling it well and bullying me about it. Our mutual friends told me to be honest with him because he of all people would understand the struggle, so i did. But i don\u2019t feel i am getting the support i need from him and i expressed that to him. \nNow heres the main story:\nA few days ago i had a terrible panic attack, i was sick and so shaky i couldn\u2019t walk. My parents rushed me to the ER and it was bad enough to get admitted to hospital where i underwent many tests, one of them was an MRI, I\u2019m not claustrophobic and didnt think it was a big deal until the last 5 minutes, something overwhelmed me and i went into a massive panic/seizure like state. I would update him everything that happens and he did show concern. The problem is, if he loves me like he says he does, why didnt he come to see me when ive been here for 4 days and still dont know when im getting discharged. Am I overthinking this?? \nP.S. this was my first time staying overnight at the hospital and never experienced anything like this..\n\n",

It all started when our washing machine broke and it flooded our room; I called him to come home asap to help me but he said he had to \u201cget a new license plate for his sister\u201d (I\u2019m an international student, I live with him; I have no family and my friends were working, so they couldn\u2019t help me. His sister has her bf, her dad, mom, stepmom, stepdad, friends; a lot of people she could reach out to help her, while I only had my bf). He did not came home to help me, so a big fight started. During that fight, he said that I would only be his priority over his family, If i\u2019m between life or death.\n\nAfter that fight, things became really bad here. We only started getting better at around end of June. Something that I noticed is that we always had each other\u2019s phone password, but we never looked at each other\u2019s phone. Sometimes I would take his phone to google something, or take pictures or use the calculator, but all the times with him next to me. Lately, every time I try to take his phone to do something basic, he grabs the phone quickly, or even when we are watching tiktoks together (we used to do that all the time) he turns the phone to himself so I can\u2019t see anything.\n\nYesterday I had a problem with my steam and a game, so some hours ago, I went on his PC (since he has the game downloaded already) to try to fix it. When I opened google to search something, I saw an instagram notification saying \u201cwe gotta delete this message before someone sees it\u201d. I\u2019m not stupid, so of course I went to see what was that about. It was an answer to the post I did yesterday to him, celebrating our 2 years of relationship\u2026\n\nSo basically this guy is an ex coworker (they used to be very close). I get the jokes on his part, but my bf\u2019s answer sounded so true\u2026 The way he said \u201cngl, you do more than her\u201d, that broke my heart in tiny little pieces\u2026 \n\nDo I have a reason to feel that way, or am I just overreacting from a \u201cfunny\u201d conversation?

We recently had a tough patch as we both went through some mental health issues but came back together in the end around 3 weeks ago after a month break.\n\nThis morning I checked my tiktok to see the videos he sent and his profile picture was different - a character from a show that I don't know. When I asked him about it he said that his hg had asked him to match profile pictures to make another boy jealous. I had never heard of this girl so I asked who she was but he ended up avoiding the main question and just explained that he had met her and become very close 2 months ago while we were still dating. I don't think he is the type to cheat on me and he hasn't been acting strange or different since he started matching. I then explained that I was feeling jealous as me and him always talk openly about our feelings but he just said that there was nothing to be jealous about and she was just a friend. \n\nThe matching profile pictures are a couple profile picture and I eventually texted the girl just to see if she knew about me or if he was cheating. She hasn't responded yet and I haven't spoken to him about it after the conversation I had. \n\nThe photos i have attached are the message i sent to her and the matching profile pictures between him and her. \n\nAm I overreacting or do we think he is actually cheating?\n\nUPDATE - \nThis is absolutely insane what just went down. \n\nFirst off thank you everyone for the advice and help. It really helped me understand the situation.\n\nI got a response from the girl which made everything spiral downhill, but I'll start from where I left off.\n\nI got a response from him about who she was and he said that he met her on TikTok and that they were good friends. And then didn't respond for two hours since he was at the gym. \n\nThe girl he was matching with responded and was very defensive at first and said \"I'm sorry but girl what? YOUR boyfriend? what are you talking about. are you delusional or something, you are his ex, you are not together anymore.\" which from then I explained me and him had gotten back together around 3 weeks ago and she told me that he hadn't told her we got back together. After around 5 minutes that he texted me asking if I texted her and then told me \"We need to break up\", \"I don't love you anymore\", \"Bye\" and then blocked me.\n\nAfter that I started talking to the other girl to make sure she was okay and she told me they hadn't been dating but were flirty and he spoke about dating her. Me and her have been talking to each other and just making sure we are okay. \n\nThank you to everyone reading this, I don't know if there will be another update ever but to all those who commented and helped you are angels <3",

As the title says, I felt like I was treated differently once my boss realized that I was straight.\n\nI was promoted around April last year, and at first things were going really well with my boss. I\u2019m a yoga instructor and into fashion, and I don\u2019t fit the most stereotypical \u201cmasculine\u201d image, so I guess people sometimes make assumptions about me.\n\nA few months later, my boss was venting and said, \u201cI just can\u2019t stand straight males.\u201d When I mentioned that I\u2019m straight, she quickly shifted to, \u201cOh, I meant straight white males,\u201d since I\u2019m a person of color. After that, things started going downhill fast.\n\nSoon it felt like she wanted me to quit. I kept showing up and doing my best because I loved the job, but I was constantly running into what felt like sabotage. During a conversation about company policy, she yelled at me and ended with, \u201cI just don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a good fit for this team.\u201d Not long after, my schedule was changed, my hours were cut, and I was even asked to work overtime without getting paid for it.\n\nWhen she later found out I had a girlfriend, she began making over-the-top comments like, \u201cOh, she calls you baby? That\u2019s so cute, you have pet names!\u201d At first it seemed playful, but over time it felt mocking and passive-aggressive. I even felt like some of the schedule changes were meant to make it harder for my girlfriend and I to have time off together.\n\nI don\u2019t work there anymore, but reflecting on it today made me wonder: Am I overreacting to think this was discrimination? \n",

        "Background": "A few days ago me (23M) and my girlfriend (21F) went to a pumpkin patch/farm we planned to visit weeks ago. We had fun feeding animals, picking pumpkins, and taking pictures.\n\nThe next day, she wanted to ask me \u201cserious question.\u201d Basically, she remembered me saying I\u2019d been to the same farm before. For context, I was invited by my friend Hazel, her baby, and her sister back in May (so at the time it wasn't a pumpkin patch, just a regular farm experience). My gf knows about Hazel; I know her and have been friends with her since November 2023 at my last job. My gf asked if I went with a guy friend, and I said no, I went with my friend Hazel, her baby, and her sister.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say to her is that I didn\u2019t think going to a public place again should change anything, and that we could go to many places without tying a specific person to the location; any of our friends, guy or girl (or in this case, a girl). I added that if we applied her logic, that would eliminate a lot of the places we could go to/we had gone to (like the park or the mall for example.)\n\nAnother thing to add for context - Nothing romantic ever happened with Hazel. It was just friends hanging out at a farm. IMO, I do get what she's trying to say even though she says I don't, but I don't think it's realistic for *literally* everything to be a first-time experience. All I say is that we can still go to places or do things that make the moment special, but creating false problems like this shouldn't take away from it. If that were the case, then I would have to keep it in the back of my mind for every place I had gone to in the past and consider if I went with a woman or not for the sake of making her feel special.\n\nAm I wrong for thinking this is overthinking, or is her perspective valid?\n\n**Edit**: If you want to see more \"serious\" conversations between me and my gf, feel free to look on my profile to get a better perspective on the dynamic between our relationship.",

In early August, I found out the guy I was dating had tried getting with my (then) best friend about 3 weeks before he asked me out, and in that process he had tried putting me down only to 'make her feel better about herself' (This is the story he told me when we first broke up. He said he knew she always compared herself to me, and he didn't want to make her feel bad by saying I was\u00a0**pretty.**\u00a0The context was 'ranking all the baddies at our high school'. He asked her to rank the guys, he'd rank the girls. She was #5, and when she asked about me, he said\u00a0**I wasn't his type**\u00a0nor pretty and that she 100% was. Throughout the entire conversation, she was uplifting me so he would like me. I appreciate her for that.) After I found out about these screenshots, I broke up with him immediately and spent the next few days trying to get over the fact that he could say that stuff about me.\n\nWe sort of got back together a couple weeks later, and since then I've always had the\u00a0*lingering*\u00a0feeling that he only got with me because I was the easiest, and second closest option to her. Everytime I tried to bring it up, he would give me different stories on why he did x, y, and z. I never knew what was true and what was false, because after every conversation we had about the topic, I would be comforting him into believing he wasn't a bad person/boyfriend for ever saying those things about me.\u00a0**I never felt that was true.**\n\nTonight, I brought up the situation again because it has been giving me panic attacks for the past couple of nights, and I just wanted see if I get any more closure on the situation. At first, he was honest and finally admitted that he did have feelings for her in the past, and directly before this situation all happened. He claimed that he thought she was crazy, and that's why he didn't want anything more than friendship with her the second time he got feelings for her. I believed him. I like him, after all. I think he's so loving of me now and very sweet to me day-to-day.\n\nI asked him why he thought to call her pretty, and prettier than me, in the first place. After telling me a different story from what he told me three weeks ago when I asked the same question, he started claiming he doesn't remember what's true and what's false. I said that I think he tried getting with her, couldn't, and claimed a different story to it.\n\nI'm not only upset because he lied, but I was also upset with the rest, and what I presumed to be true. I don't know what to believe, and what to do. I really like him, at least I thought. In some regard, he's reminding me of my ex. That boy did similar things to me in the past, but at an exponential rate. I want to give him another chance, but I can't find a reason why. I like who he is now, after all. Maybe he did forget. I have had situations where I couldn't tell my own lies apart from reality. I also know that right now, I'm going through a terrible depressive episode and I don't want to lose one of my bestfriends on top of everyone else.

We loaded my mom into my car, and I told Lia to contact me on Saturday for an update.\n\nCome Saturday, Lia didn\u2019t have my phone number because she used my mom\u2019s phone to call me.

        "Background": "Hi everyone! This is throw away account. As the title says, I feel like I got manipulated by a man to become his side chick. I have very little dating experience so I am super confused and I need to know if I am overeating/being stupid/going crazy. Sorry there is quite a bit of rambling. \r\nSo I met this guy in my dancing class. At the end of the second class, he asked me if I would want to do some extra practice with him over the weekend, I said yes why not, he messaged me the address later that night and we went to that studio to practice the day after. The studio is not that easy to get to compared to other ones in my city, so it ended up just two of us dancing for 3, 4 hrs straight (i didn\u2019t know this before i actually went there) . And this weekend practice thing kept going for another 2, 3 weeks. He put some effort to teach me new movement, complimenting my progress and we started talking about other things in our lives. I could feel that he started making advance towards me. He offered to take me on a motorcycle ride when he found out I had never been on one before. Meanwhile we kept seeing each other in the usual dancing class and he started to consistently try to dance with me for both the opening and closing dance (he purposely walks towards me so I would be right next to him when the opening and closing dance start).  My mind was like  \u201cI can spend a bit more time with him to see how things go\u201d . It is always good to practice with someone who dances well and he seemed to be a nice person. \r\nOne day after classes (I am only attending the lvl1 class as I just started this style while he stays for lvl 2 and 3), he drove to my place (he dropped me off that time we went on the motorcycle ride so he knows where my address bruhhh) and called me to come down coz he needed to tell me sth. He said he wanted to be fully honest and transparent with me, coz we dancing together could turn into \u201csth else\u201d. He said he is in a \u201ccontract\u201d with a lady. They came from the same country and they know each other since childhood. When they moved here they felt venerable and just got together.  The lady told him at the very beginning that she had no intention to make this relationship a long term one coz she ultimately wants to move to Spain while the guy wants to stay. But he feels that he is responsible for taking care of her and let her get on a partner visa with him. Their \u201ccontract\u201d was supposed to end in Sep 25, but she decided to stay till Jan 26, so the \u201ccontract\u201d extended. They are separating coz ultimately she is leaving, and Jan 26 would be a new start for him so on so forth. After that conversation, I was under the impression that, their relationship is now just for appearance for the sake of the lady\u2019s visa and there is little to none emotional substance left. I don\u2019t think this arrangement is right in a lot of ways. But ultimately whatever arrangement they have is not of my concern. I thought I would just keep him at arms length as someone I practice dancing with and didn\u2019t really think too much of it. \r\nThe next time we practice together, we finished till very late, so we went out of the studio to get some dinner. He again cycled back to the \u201ccontract\u201d he talked about and said that the lady recognised that it is unfair for him, so she allows him space to go out dancing and meet other ppl. And while we were eating , that lady in question actually called him and he told her straight away that he was having dinner with me. After the call he said again they are going separate ways and everything ends in January no matter what happens woth that lady. I believed in what he said coz couldn\u2019t think of why someone would be OK with their partner spending extended amount of time dancing and hanging out with someone else (by that time we have been practicing just two of us for about a month). I was still feeling a bit unsure about the whole thing, but I don\u2019t want to appear to be judgemental of their situation. I was on visa as well and I understand that sometimes it is a difficult situation to be in. I thought I would just see how things go, coz still at that time I didn\u2019t think he had bad intention, so I accepted his advances towards me, which now MAKES ME WANT TO PUNCH MYSELF! \r\nSo we started messaging each other maybe every 2, 3 days. He called me once or twice. We talked about other hobbies, work and family stuff, so it was getting personal and sometimes it got a bit flirty. But because his \u201ccontract\u201d with the lady, I never made up my mind regarding him. \r\nOne day, he messaged me saying he deleted some of our text messages on his phone. They lady found out and was not happy about that so they .... broke up?! I was so very confused, coz all the time I was under the impression that it is no longer an actual relationship and they have in reality already broken up. I instantly felt that he was lying to me, I got a bit angry and replied saying \u201cplz don\u2019t involve me in your guys\u2019 problem and I will not be going to that studio again\u201d. He said he understood and this is his fault. After thinking about it for a while, I thought it could be genuinely a really messed up situation and it is never fun to break up with someone, and the tone of my message might be a bit harsh for what he was going through (OMG I AM SUCH A PPL PLEASER!), so when he messaged me saying he wouldn\u2019t make it to class on time, I messaged back saying \u201cI hope you are doing ok\u201d. He basically said he is trying to move on and then asked me to help him with his translation exam. This was not coming out of nowhere as he did mention he had an exam the following week and I had done similar exam before. I knew that could be an excuse he made up to see me, but I wanted to know what exactly happened(maybe not the smartest idea), so I agreed to me meet him. \r\nWe worked on his exam material then we went out to get some food after. So I asked him what exactly happened. He repeated the same thing. I said, I only let you make advances because I thought your relationship is just for appearance and for the lady\u2019s visa and she is allowing you to meet other ppl. He then said, the lady\u2019s visa is not actually a parent visa with him??????? He followed up saying maybe he didn\u2019t say it clearly, but it was him offer to get her a partner visa so she doesn\u2019t have to study and work at the same time but the lady refused. \u201cBut you said she allows you to meet other ppl, was the relationship or not?\u201d He said \u201cwell there is feeling left and she saw the rest of the message and thought we have a physical relationship, well maybe in January we feel like it, it might happen. But yeah she wasn\u2019t happy and she broke up with me. Well, there is nothing else then coz we actually broke up. Though it was supposed to be January, but now there is nothing left. And I need to move on.\u201d I felt so very confused, like since when did I give him the idea that we might get physical?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!??!?! So I made it very clear when we parted,  he even tried to kiss me but I resisted saying \u201cthis is going too quickly and I am confused. We are not at the stage where I feel ok with you kissing me\u201d. He said he understood and he said bye and left. I thought that's it, we stopped messaging for the whole week. \r\nBut last Friday in class (Halloween) he showed up early in costume (he knows i am always early coz i take public transport and i am need to be super early or i would be super late), and bought me a matching headpiece to wear. I didn\u2019t think much of it, like it is just Halloween stuff, I am not that into dressing up as a character but it could be just me. So I just wore it and we danced the opening. While we were dancing other ppl started to arrive and were watching us dancing. When the class started and we swapped dance partner, one girl asked him if he and I are sticking together and not changing partner (usually we rotate partners unless a couple come together to class and say that they want to stick together). I felt weird, now i wasn\u2019t so sure if he did that custom and dancing thing on purpose to let other ppl see it. But it would look rude if i refuse to dance with him so I didn\u2019t say or do anything. Again he grabbed me for the closing dance and walked me to the bus stop. I said what is the costume about. He just said it is Halloween. I thought I was just thinking too much. The next day when we went to the dance school for practice (not the one that is hard to get to, but the one of the dancing school where there are a lot of other ppl), he seemed a bit distant. I thought if he wanted to distant I would just let him. Plus he was busy taking videos for the teachers for a demonstration. I didn\u2019t think much of it. But he again followed me to the bust stop after the practice finished but another person was going to the same bus stop , I could tell he wanted to talk to me but coz of the other person was there he couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t think much of it, if it is important he could text me.\r\nThen the next day, I was watching some videos about the dance movement we tried during the practice and I sent it to him. He them replied with a HUGE paragraph saying he is now back with that lady?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!? And said we can still dance together ?!??!?!?!??! And that lady actually knows me??!?!??!!? And think I would be good dancer?!?!??!?!?!?!\r\nI am just beyond confused now. I feel like he is lying about sth. And he is trying to manipulate me to be his side piece. But again, if he just wanted to have a side piece, there is no need for him to tell me about the lady. Who breaks up and get back together within just a week????? I did a bit of digging online, I can see there is an account with the name of that said lady on FB, but it is private so I didn\u2019t get much info out of it. I replied to him, set some boundaries, he agreed. It looks like this saga is ending for real. But I am not sure if he is going to pull some other stuns if we see each other again in class. I am now contemplating that I should just stop going to that dance school. But idk if I am overeating. It could be he is just genuinely confused about his feeling in a complicated situation and that is the end of it and there would be nothing else between us. \r\nThis is getting too long, but guys! Plz tell me if I am overeating! Am I just being so very stupid??? Am i missing sth??? Thanks for reading! \r\n\r\n",

When my husband came home from work, I showed him the messages and told him that she made me very uncomfortable and that he should seriously reevaluate his friendship with her. He was not happy about the texts, and reassured me that I wasn't controlling and that he would call her and yell at her about that. However while he didn\u2019t say it outright he heavily implied he wasn\u2019t willing to end his friendship over this. He talked about how long he\u2019d known her, how she\u2019d helped him through some dark times, and how she was usually the nicest person and this was completely out of character.

He did say he was going to make her apologize to me and put their friendship on \"time-out\" if she refused (I have not received an apology so not sure what's going on there).\n\nI decided to drop it for the moment and sleep on it, and in the morning I woke up with a plan. I went through some older group chats and found one with her husband in it, so I reached out privately to him and attached screenshots of both the original 3am text and my convo with her. He just responded and uhh...seriously wtf. He confirmed my suspicious but also I'm just speechless, like....what even is there to say about that honestly.\n\nSo now I have a woman who hates me when I have absolutely no idea what I've done to her, trying to destroy my life and I feel as helpless as ever. I don't even know if I want to bring it up again or just try and forget about it entirely, like honestly getting into a big argument with my husband over it is just letting her win. But ugh...I kind of hate my life right now, that\u2019s for sure.

        "Background": "Okay so my bf and I recently switched apartment units to a two bedroom when our last lease ended and we\u2019ve been in the two bedroom since June of this year and we had roommates (his friend and his friends gf) move in with us at the same time we got the two bedroom. I was on the fence about roommates as I\u2019ve seen PLENTY of things stating it\u2019s a bad idea, especially if it\u2019s a friend. So for the first month and a half it was relatively fine, as it typically is bc everyone is always in their \u201cbest behavior\u201d. Things were kept clean, common areas were organized and kept tidy etc. (for reference it\u2019s a two bed two bath apartment so ion care how their room/bathroom looks mainly the common areas as that is shared space) Well one issue we\u2019ve had since they moved in is we\u2019ve always had to front more of rent then them at least 200-300 sometimes even 400. Rent is 2,400/2,500 depending on utility use. So typically it\u2019s an even 1,200 per couple. We\u2019ve always had to cover more than them bc they\u2019ve never given us the full half they owe. Now another issue we\u2019ve ran into was washing so we set up a wash schedule, I get Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday they get Monday, Thursday and Friday and Sunday is first come first serve. This past weekend they took my Saturday even tho I needed it and then also took Sunday which okay that\u2019s fine it\u2019s first come first serve. But I did move their laundry bc I rlly needed to get at least one wash in so my bf has clothes for work. I still need to do laundry as he still needs clean clothes. The next issue is the common area is always dirty. They never take out the trash, they leave their empty take out boxes and pizza boxes and bags all over the counters. The trash get overflown but we legit have valet trash service that comes Sunday-Thursday and they still can\u2019t tie up the trash and just put it out the front door for them to pick up so I am always the one picking up and cleaning the living room/kitchen. Also for reference there are 4 pets in our apartment, they have a cat and we have two dogs and a cat and the cat stays in the living room as the dogs stay in the bedroom with us, plus any one out there who owns a cat knows that sleeping at night with a cat that gets zoomies at 3am isn\u2019t fun lol. So because my cat stays out there I take responsibility for sweeping and mopping making sure his litter box is clean. Bc ik he stays out there and the dogs run around out there sometimes so I don\u2019t complain about sweeping and mopping and doing his litter box bc ik it\u2019s my pets that make most the mess. Aside from that anytime I have trash or make myself something to eat I throw it away. They leave theirs all over the counters and then it ends up in the floor and whatever else. They also leave all their dirty dishes in the sink even when the dishwasher is dirty. We made an agreement that whatever dishes you use, you clean em or put em in the dish washer. They still don\u2019t do that. We have a small white board that we have our wash schedule on and today I went and added the new rule we agree to about the dishes but I also added the valet trash service schedule so that way they are aware of it. I\u2019ve told them their schedule for that before but I added it to the whiteboard so it\u2019s known without any issue. After adding everything I put the white board on the laundry room door bc the laundry room is right in front of their bathroom door so there is no way they can miss it. I have been trying to be nice and polite about the fact that they don\u2019t clean up their mess so me putting the white board practically right in front of of their face was my subtle but still polite way of trying to convey the rules and agreements we have and also subtly let them know \u201cHey I\u2019m don\u2019t picking up after yall, I\u2019m not your mother or your maid\u201d So I need to know am I overreacting and being a dick about putting the white board right in front of their face or am I justified? (Also for reference I\u2019m a stay at home gf bc my bf makes enough money that I don\u2019t rlly need to work and I stay home to take care of the dogs as they are both still under a year old. Even being a stay at home gf that doesn\u2019t make it my job to clean up after two other grown ass adults bc I\u2019m not their mother, not their maid, and not their gf) I have attached photos for reference on how they leave the kitchen along with the chore list.

We\u2019ve been together for 1,5 year now\n\nWhile we were lying together, he was on ChatGPT, and as a joke I peeked over to see what he was doing (I wasn\u2019t snooping, just teasing him). But then I noticed a chat on his chatgpt that honestly made my stomach drop.\n\nIt was from May, when we were already together for a year. In it, he had asked ChatGPT how to introduce himself to someone\u2019s parents when they pick him up by car. From what it looked like, he was going hiking with a girl and her parents.\n\nI completely panicked. I asked him about it, and he told me it was nothing like that. that the girl was actually the daughter of his mom\u2019s friends, and he hadn\u2019t seen them in a long time. He said they invited him hiking because the dad was also in the military like him when he was younger, and it was more about catching up with the parents.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense cause why would he need to introduce himself if they had already met before?\n\nHe kept telling me that I\u2019m everything to him, that he only loves me, and that it had nothing to do with the girl. He even texted his mom to confirm, and she said yes, but then she also asked, \u201cIs everything okay between you two?\u201d which made me feel weird.\n\nThe thing is\u2026 about a week after that hike (which I didn\u2019t even know about at the time), he told me he needed a break because the distance was getting hard for him.

These messages are in response to him texting me at work after a failed attempt at sex this morning. He told me he feels like I don\u2019t like him anymore and that Im convincing myself to love him, and that I am unsure about marrying him now because of our lackluster sex life. I feel like I have tried everything I know how to help him work through what he says is performance anxiety, but I\u2019m so sexually frustrated. I just miss feeling him and feeling desirable and sexy.\n\nFor some background, I am a pretty sexual person and I have been for the entirety of our relationship. In the beginning we\u2019d have sex multiple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day and I loved it. He always pleased me and he seemed to enjoy it too. Then something seemed to change and now he repeatedly goes flaccid during sex, sometimes before sex can even really begin and he gives up and says he\u2019s just not in the mood. I initially reacted negatively and asked if I smelled bad or if I\u2019d done something wrong, which I think may have exacerbated the problem and made him more insecure.\n\nNowadays, he and I have sex maybe one to two times a month, and when we do he doesn\u2019t orgasm and sex ends after I\u2019ve orgasmed with my vibrator or once he goes soft. It\u2019s usually the former, but I still cuddle up to him and tell him I love him and had fun because I don\u2019t want him to work himself up and feel worse so that his anxiety stacks for next time. It doesn\u2019t work though. We have been having the same issue now on and off for two years.\n\nI\u2019ve encouraged him to go to the doctor for a while now to make sure he is okay, but he always been so embarrassed. I think he might have sleep apnea (not really related to the ED, but just to mention in case) but he is otherwise a healthy, young, relatively fit guy, and I really believe it\u2019s caused by anxiety like he said. I made him a doctor\u2019s appointment this month anyways just in case. If it is anxiety though, where has it come from?\n\nI worry that it really is me and that he finds me unattractive but is scared to tell me. I\u2019m pregnant right now, 21 weeks, and hadn\u2019t been feeling well enough in my first trimester to have sex as often as I really wanted to. Now I feel better and I just want to have him all the time, but he\u2019s always too tired and when he is in the mood on the weekends, we have issues with his ED. I just don\u2019t know what to do and I feel like I\u2019m worried about our sexual compatibility if we do get married. Everything was good for the first year though and I love him so much. Am I overreacting by worrying about our future together because of this?\n\ntl;dr: My relatively healthy fianc\u00e9 has struggled with erectile dysfunction and low sex drive due to performance anxiety for the majority of our relationship, and I\u2019m starting to worry that this may be a dealbreaker if we can\u2019t find a solution soon.",

I was mad that day and realized this whole situation was going to be a problem. \n\nThe blocked mail died down a little, we sometimes would still get the mail marked \"blocked\"........until this week.\n\nWe haven't gotten our mail for like 5/6 days already and my family and I were mad. My dad especially because his package was supposed to come 3 days ago and got a message it was now being held at the post office. I was hoping maybe something was just weird with the post office and not the mailman being some weird a-hole. So we waited for the mailman on Friday. He skipped us again and continued on his route. At one point my dad noticed TWO HOUSES HAD THEIR MAIL BOXES BLOCKED AND HE WALKED OUT OF THE VAN TO DELIVER THE MAIL. \n\nTo see if it was him or something was weird we gave him once chance. Today we had a garage sale so my dad was posted out front waiting for him. Again he skipped us. My dad and I wanted to be responsible so we guessed maybe something was weird in the post office system?? So I put in a report that we haven't gotten our mail for days. \n\nDuring work today I got an email saying...get this...\n\n\n\"We wanted to inform you that your mailbox has been blocked by a vehicle, which prevents our letter carrier from safely delivering your mail. For mounted mailboxes, carriers are not required to exit their vehicles to make delivery. To ensure uninterrupted service, please clear the area around your mailbox so it is safely and easily accessible from the carrier's vehicle.\"\n\nWE HAVENT EVEN HAD A CAR OUT ON THE STREET FOR LIKE 3 DAYS HOPING THE MAIL MAN WOULD GIVE US OUR MAIL. NOT EVEN TODAY \n\nI was really mad at this point so I made a report against the mailman and said our mail box isn't blocked and that they still skip us, while I was at work. I got a voice mail since I was working and o m g....\n\nThey left a voice mail saying they TALLKED TO THE CARRIER SAYING THE REASON THEY HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO GIVE US OUR MAIL IS BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A VEHICLE BLOCKING THE MAILBOX\n\nIM SO CLOSE TO CRASHING OUT LIKE THIS \ud83e\udd0f CLOSE, I'm a shy person but I literally feel my inner Karen begging to be released \ud83d\udc80 \n\nI have mad respect for mail carriers but why is this one like this? My family and I have never done anything to him and we have always made sure our car was pulled up to the edge. AT THIS POINT WE CANT EVEN PARK ON OUR OWN STREET. \n\nUnfortunately when I tried calling them back they were closed so now I have to wait till Monday \ud83d\ude2d, I hope I don't overreact to much if I call?? I feel a little bad but still he keeps doing this. \n\nHere's a picture of how we park our car, mind you it's a Prius so it's not huge like a van or anything. \n",

Like the list goes on and on and honestly I need to write a book about this\ud83d\ude2d who would read it\u2026\n\nWhat I said\u2026.\n\n\u201c I cannot help you I don\u2019t know how many times I have to tell you. I\u2019m trying to be kind and look at it from your perspective but I\u2019ve told you everything that you need to know I cannot move things around. I am busy. I am sorry I can\u2019t help you right now but you\u2019re just gonna have to figure it out. You are capable and you are a strong woman and mother, and I believe in you. take an Uber to AutoZone. you know I\u2019m not choosing ****** over you. I want you to trust in my ability to take care of myself. I already know I need my headlight fixed that\u2019s why I told you I\u2019m taking it to get looked at. I\u2019m also capable. I get that you are my mother, and nothing will ever change that. I love you and I see you, and I know you are struggling and I see your pain. You are loved. But I need to take a step back. I cannot continue this current cycle. I am hurting and i am healing. I need to look after myself and I am tired of feeling like I have to fix things for you just because you\u2019re my \u201cmother.\u201d I am bound to you by blood, but I feel like our relationship has been harmed, from the past not being properly addressed, and not taking accountability. ****** and I constantly worry about you. I am remembering I used to stay up night, after night terrified and paralyzed by the thought that you might not be okay. Because I feel like I haven\u2019t had consistent evidence telling me otherwise. My life has been completely shifted because of the fact that you are unwilling to address your mental illness in a way that will actually help you and in a way that doesn\u2019t involve your kids. I don\u2019t know if you are ready to accept the fact that you have not only hurt yourself, but hurt your entire family around you.\n\n(this is not to make you feel shame. This is not to make you feel like you are not worthy of love. I am only telling you this with the intention to heal and start a new cycle with you. With love, honesty, and kindness.)\n\nI want a relationship with you. I want you to be my mother. But I cannot continue like this.\n\nIn your words \u201cI guess I\u2019m a bad mother and you don\u2019t love me.\u201d I internalized that for years and ever since I was small I always felt like I had to \u201cSave you.\u201d\n\nThe fact is you abused me, ****** and your ex-wife, ******. And continually abuse yourself and your authority as my mother. You\u2019re using being my mom as an excuse for me to help you figure out things that do not involve me. You got yourself into this mess, you can get yourself out. I can\u2019t help you. You have hurt me, and in a way, I will have to relearn how to do things all over again with the amount of shit I\u2019ve had to deal with from your actions. You held my head under water as a child while ****** and I were fighting? And I know you thought that was probably the right thing to do? But what the fuck. You choked me, you hit me. You hit ******, you choked her. You hit and choked ******. You have no idea about the extent of what you\u2019ve done to this family because you are so defensive that you cannot look at the truth of the situation. You are my mother, not my equal, and I cannot believe I have to tell you this. I do not owe you anything, especially since you haven\u2019t been there for me when I needed you. Yes, you were there for my birthday parties, when I was in the hospital, you love me, you birthed me, and you took care of me, but you abused me. Mentally and physically. You are sick. But regardless, I still love you. I\u2019m telling you this because you are my biggest block in this life. I have a right to be angry. And I am furious. I love you. But I\u2019m angry. You have told me things that I will never forget. That I have internalized, repressed, and eventually started using to forget about. You are my main reason for my addiction. You are my main reason for my pain. This is deeper than physical and what has just happened to me. This is about what has happened to you and your life. You are currently in the process of creating generational trauma. And I know growing up for you was probably very traumatic and hard, and I know you think you\u2019ve \u201cgraduated therapy\u201d or don\u2019t need it. You need help ******, not only as my mother, but as a human being. I am telling you this because no one else will. You are sick, you need help. You have money, you have friends, you have family, and I cannot help you. If you don\u2019t get help immediately and get rid of that dog, send her to a better home and if you don\u2019t clean your shit up, like your house and your life, I will go to court and get a restraining order on you. And I know you think I\u2019m crazy or manic or that this is someone else\u2019s doing or somebody else telling me about you and spreading lies. I have seen the facts. I\u2019ve seen it for myself. I know everything I need to know about the situation. And quite frankly, I haven\u2019t been sane in years. I have tried for 20 years, almost 21 years, to help you. I moved in with you for a year. I cleaned up your mess by myself. I ended up in rehab and the psych ward and relapsed. And you continue to ask for my help. I appreciate you trying to mend our relationship with gifts, and those comicon tickets were really sweet and I had a great time. I know you love me and I know you love me. I love you in ways you don\u2019t even know and this is why I\u2019m telling you. Please get help, I cannot help you. I love you, mommy. And if you contact ****** about this and try and change my mind, that will only make my decision of filing a restraining order much easier. I know you think this is probably easy for me, but this is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019m currently crying and I\u2019ve had multiple panic attacks about the fact that I have to let you help yourself and change for the better, so I can heal. If you truly, in your heart of hearts, love me and care for me, like you say you do, you will respect my decision, and seek either a higher power or someone else to help you or not have a relationship with me. I highly recommend an AA group and working your 12 steps. You might not think you need it, but I believe you do. I believe you are a \u201cdry drunk,\u201d and you haven\u2019t actually recovered. You have just repressed and denied for years. I recommend you find a higher power other than yourself and make amends. If I am working the steps as a 20-year-old, you can work the steps if you want the relationship you feel like you deserve with me. I recommend getting a sponsor (It\u2019s free) and I recommend you start your healing journey not only for yourself, but for your relationships. It is honestly up to you and what you want. This is your decision, choose wisely. I love you, please take care of yourself.\n\nIf you try to show up to my house in this moment in time, I will call the police. If you go through ****** to contact me, I will get a restraining order. If you\u2019re trying to use anyone or anything to see me, I will get a restraining order. Right now I cannot see you. I do not feel safe with you mentally. I am triggered beyond repair and need time to heal. And since you\u2019re in the mood for demanding, I will demand this: you allow me the space, and you will not hurt anybody that I love because you have done enough. You cannot heal things with gifts and love, you have to face your shit head-on, apologize, take accountability, and actively try and change. All I\u2019m asking is for you to try. And trust me, I have tried. I asked you to go to therapy, and you said no, so I\u2019m done for now. I love you, take care of yourself.*\nI\u2019ve personally contacted someone at Pro Hazard to help you out. His name is ******. And he needs your permission to be able to clean your space up.\nThis is his number: ****** \u201c\n\n\nMy moms response\u2026.\n\n\u201cI thought I have taken full responsibility for everything I have done. Over and over again and again. I cannot take responsibility for what I have not done. And the more time you spend listening to ***** the more injured you become with your anger toward me.\n\nBut for my responsibility for my actions: You were so strong as a child and when you would attack *****, I HAD to pull you off of her the best way I could. It was rough, but it was not abuse my love. It was violent, it was you being violent because of the rage caused by your misophonia. You couldn\u2019t help it, and my goal was to get you secluded so you wouldn\u2019t injure us. There are still holes in the door from your rage. It\u2019s a neurological disorder. You would charge at me like a bull, hitting me as hard as you could, trying to push me over. I resisted. It was very physical. But it was not abuse. From me or you. It was emotional and neurological from you. I had to be strong and had to handle you firmly but with care. If you recall any hitting on my part during these times I\u2019m so sorry *****. I don\u2019t remember it that way.\n\nSomething to heal from:\nI do know you were traumatized by our forced separation when you were 8 years old. I was too. That needs to be recognized and honored as that was very traumatizing and painful. I do believe that is where a lot of your sadness, pain, and anger towards me stems from, and blaming me for the separation has always been the story. However, my trauma and your trauma stem from *****'s weaponization of therapists and the court to get that outcome she paid for. It damaged all of us. She has to continue her version of the story in order to live with herself and the damage she did to us.\n\nApology:\nIf I have not apologized for any wrongdoing that I actually did to you from your own memory, then please allow me that privilege. What I do know is that ***** continues to tell you horrible untrue things about me that are causing you to have negative thoughts, feelings, and reactions. I know this because I have dealt with this for years. All these untruths are meant to hurt me, but they are hurting you honey. Like using the words \u201ctried to drown you.\u201d Give me a break. I dunked you at the popcorn pool all the time while teaching you to swim at this age. All I did was let the water hit your face and you stopped trying to bite *****. Do you see how stories meant to harm me actually harm you? She wasn\u2019t even there. I told her over the phone. It was very uneventful. The main point was you stopped trying to bite ***** because you held your breath for a brief second.\n\nTime away and pain relief:\nI\u2019d gladly walk away from you if that would ease your pain and heal you but I don\u2019t think it would because you continue to engage in conversations with ***** that are aimed at alienating you and me (it\u2019s working by the way) causing you more pain. Rinse and repeat!\n\nReality orientation:\nBut know this my love.\nI\u2019m so sorry for the times I hurt you emotionally or physically. As for my mental illness, it is a trauma response (frozen) caused by the narcissistic and borderline abuse I endured from ***** during our divorce and custody battle. And work trauma combined. Know that you are not responsible for ANYTHING having to do with taking care of me, nothing. You are also NOT responsible to have to listen to *****'s version of history because she has documented mental illnesses that require her mind to distort reality to preserve her ego. So, stop listening to that crap, it will continue to injure you and distort your reality and memories. You can have a copy of a lengthy parenting evaluation that is a legal representation of our home life where ***** DENIES any and ALL physical violence in our home. Except admitting to hitting me a few times and kicking me when I was pregnant. Stop listening to her distortions, they are not reality-based. Her stories are meant to make you not feel safe, trust, or want to have anything to do with me. Because that is how SHE feels.\n\nTaking care of myself:\nI know you are worried about me.\nYou \u201chad\u201d every right to worry and be scared and angry. I almost died ***** and then my body betrayed me while I was healing and I became chronically ill and couldn\u2019t walk or do anything. You felt helpless, and angry, and resentful. I couldn\u2019t reassure you because I was fighting to reassure me. But I survived, I fought my way back and I\u2019m so lucky. I\u2019m walking, working, and beginning to thrive.\nI\u2019m still stuck in the frozen part of fight or flight mode, but I am recognizing what is actually going on with me and that\u2019s the first step to wellness. Thank you for the cleaner contact.\n\nAs for the ride to *****:\nI apologize for triggering you with being adamant you give me a ride. It didn\u2019t weigh as much for me as it did you, and I had a completely different perspective because I didn\u2019t know you felt the way you did.\n\nYou take all the time away from me that you need. Know that I love and miss you.\u201d\n\n\nP.S. with me \u201cBreaking down the door and leaving holes in it.\u201d Is literally because she wouldn\u2019t let me leave the house after hitting me!! And locked me in the fu*king bedroom!! I was like 10 or 11 like she was wayyyy over 200 pounds\ud83d\ude2d what is a 5\u20194-5\u20193 chubby lil 10 year old gonna do to this women?

        "Background": "original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/cuTNBSNi4E\n\nwelp turns out he definitely was cheating and is definitely a narcissist.\n\nonce he came to town, he gave me some story about how he just needed time to process things and he was sorry that he did that to me over text out of town.\n\nHe had asked me to sleep in the bed with me and the baby that night and I asked him if he could give me some space and sleep in the living room , so he did.\n\nThe next morning he didn\u2019t have any work and was at my house. I saw a notification on my camera so I went to go check his location which he still had on. I saw a charge on his chime account for $33 at a local restaurant which I thought was strange. So of course I asked him what he was doing and he immediately got defensive saying he was just with his male cousin and had to spot him because he forgot his wallet and why am I even looking at his chime. I had a horrible gut feeling so I called the Mexican restaurant and basically told her that I shared a joint account with my parter and saw a charge with the exact amount, and I needed to know if he was with a female or male because I felt like something was going on. I described him and she put me on hold for a few mins.\n\n\u201cYeah mama im sorry it looks like he was here with a female\u201d my heart literally dropped into my stomach. I was at work on my lunch break, and of course started having a complete meltdown because everything started coming to the light. She even ended up sending me a picture of them sitting together which I know she could\u2019ve gotten in a lot of trouble for, but I knew if I didn\u2019t have the actual evidence he would\u2019ve been able to trick me into thinking I was crazy.\n\nSo I acted like I didn\u2019t know anything and asked him if he could meet me at the house on my lunch so we could have a discussion about what we were going to do about us moving forward since things had been awkward. Once I got home, I asked him what he wanted to do. He stated \u201c honestly it\u2019s just so annoying. I can\u2019t ever do anything without you questioning me or accusing me of things. I just don\u2019t think I can do this anymore, I can\u2019t even go eat with my cousin\u201d so I turned my phone around with the photo, pulled up and said \u201c so this is your cousin?\u201d His face went completely blank. It didn\u2019t take long for me to start getting angry and asking why and who and he didn\u2019t want to tell me at first, but I told him the least thing he could do for me is tell me the girls name so after about an hour, I finally got him to tell me who she was.\n\nOnce I had a conversation with her, she basically told me that they started talking the day before he left for work 6 hours away online for that entire week. (I am 26F, he is 30M and this woman is 38F with 3 children of her own) So the day he blocked me and broke up with me over the pictures in my phone from the past was the same day he ended up coming back to town and staying at her house. He had told her we hadn\u2019t been together since before I gave birth to my daughter that he owned my home and that he owned my car and just let me drive it because he felt bad for me. He never met a woman that cared like her, or looked out for him like her. He told her that I was just a miserable bitch that wouldn\u2019t let him leave, And told her he loved her and that he wanted to be her soulmate after only knowing her for two weeks, they definitely had sex, and she definitely believed every word he said about me. He took her out to eat multiple times, went to her house and lord knows what else. I finally realized that he is a narcissist and I feel completely empty alone and abandoned. I was completely loyal and invested in this person and just had a baby by him 5 months ago. Everything feels like a lie.\n\nHe showed up today to bring a box of diapers and wipes. He had brand new chains on,brand new pants, a brand new shirt, brand new sunglasses and a brand new hat. Even a new tattoo. But I should be happy he sent 400$ since all this happened and he\u2019s taken this girl out numerous times and \u201che doesn\u2019t live here anymore so why should he have to pay the mortgage\u201d \u201cI have to pay rent to sleep on a couch\u201d He has a great job now and I still struggle. I plan to file for child support but at this moment, I can\u2019t stand to think about my daughter being around a random stranger. Seeing him in person is so conflicting, like I still look at him and love him but I also despise him for doing this to us and disgusted that he was intimate with a random woman.\n\nOf course he\u2019s sorry and loves me more than anyone im the most beautiful and wants his family back and would rather die without us and he hates himself for doing this to me but now that i know he\u2019s a narcissist i can\u2019t believe a word he says to me.\n\nYall please send me good vibes or prayers or whatever you believe in, I haven\u2019t eaten in 13 days and am struggling to keep going. How can someone be so evil and so good at making you feel insane but also make you feel loved at the same time? I will never trust a soul again. :)\n\nThe woman has blocked him on everything since we spoke the 2nd time, once I started sending her the screenshots of him emailing me because I had blocked him, of him saying what a giant mistake he made and how much he loved me and what could he do to get me back while telling her he wasn\u2019t speaking with me. I think she finally started to realize he was a narcissist because I believe she has dealt with one in this past. and he swears he will do whatever to fix this, he\u2019ll do whatever I need to trust him because he can\u2019t live without me and his family. \n\n\nThank you for all the love, and for the slut shaming and \u201cyou deserved it\u201d comments on the OG post, fuck off.\n\nUpdated again because I didn\u2019t censor the photo enough. \n",

We do not follow each other on social media because we just didn\u2019t think it was necessary.  i had a habit where id check my bfs insta account but i stopped because of the trust i had built up with him as well as his location.

Anyways to the story i was at work today and i was just on instagram scrolling and for the first time in a while i checked his profile and saw he had a new bio which i didn\u2019t think too much of but idk something told me to check his following and when i clicked on the people he followed the first thing i saw was about 3 to 5 female account  promoting their OF site. There was pictures of them posting half nude and even fully nude and stuff. I tried to brush it off but once i got home i just couldn\u2019t\u2026 i tried to confront him in a way were i didn\u2019t tell him about the accounts because i had a feeling he\u2019d know it was about the accounts.  It got me really irritated that he was trying to act ignorant about the whole situation. Turns out i was right because once i mentioned the break i immediately went back to his instagram and i saw he had unfollowed almost all the females i had seen. (He still follows around 2 to 3.

        "Background": "When my twins were born my dad and step mom came over to drop off some food, my husband family was visiting at the same time & being a newly postpartum mom & in the chaos of people coming over , I think I was too shocked to even react fully in the moment. I had my preemie daughter laying in bed in front of me while I was holding her sister. My husbands family has just arrived & new mom brain I forget my dad & step mom were dropping off food at the same time. Basically my step mom walked in the bedroom where I was & leaned down & kissed my 4lb daughter on the head, in the moment I literally yelled at this woman because how dare you. For reference, my step mother is a narcissist. Many family members who go to therapy , have all said their therapist have come to this conclusion about this woman, including my own (big topic while I was pregnant, knew she would be the first to cross the line). Now I know some people don\u2019t care about family kissing their babies but that\u2019s rule number 1 to me. They\u2019re not your children , don\u2019t kiss them. I texted my dad about it later than night & the next day he responded apologizing FOR her. She never did it herself. She then proceeds to text me a few days later \u201cbaby pics please\u201d , no \u201chow are you , how are the babies?\u201d , I ignore her. She keeps texting me sending screen shots of clothing & accessory items she bought my girls, finally my dad asks why I\u2019m ignoring her & it all blows up. \n\nShe texts me in true narcissist fashion & basically blames me, says I should have given her a mask , she didn\u2019t come over trying to kill my baby & threw in an \u201comg I\u2019m so sorry\u201d in there. Not a real apology. Mind you, this woman turn my grandma & aunt against each other by spreading lies, she threatened to follow my grandma home from church to \u201ccatch\u201d her driving bad so she could have her admitted to a nursing home & take over her estate & has had most of her family cut her off because she is manipulative, called her grandchildren (blood related) names & said she doesn\u2019t give a f*ck about them after their mom cut her off (and had to threaten a restraining order). \n\nNeedless to stay, I basically told my dad after weeks of them BS apologizing that I don\u2019t want her around my children, she broke my trust (& honestly I was just waiting for this. Me & hubs both agreed she\u2019s not a person we want our kids around). My aunt & her husband have already blocked both of them, my grandparents hate her but deal with her for my dad. Now the final straw for me, she texted the family saying they weren\u2019t hosting the holidays this year , probably because nobody wants to be around her , & to \u201cleave my dad alone because he\u2019s a good man & doesn\u2019t deserve this\u201d & to \u201cback off\u201d. Nobody responded because we know she just wants a reaction. Two days later she send me a google AI response (see above) & this is where I was DONE. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to annoy me but she brought my babies into in. My step dad is a cop & told me what to say to her , basically leave me alone, this is all being documented for harassment etc. she freaked out & started blowing my phone up, one text saying \u201chow fast can you run\u201d , so I called the cops & made a report. She is the time that would call CPS on me & make up some crazy shit. Also in the midst of all this, I try to call my dad & im blocked. So that sucks. The next day my brother calls my dad to tell him he\u2019s done with him since he\u2019s choosing his wife over everyone basically & my brother is blocked too, he calls his work cell & my dad had no idea we were blocked. Who knows how long we\u2019ve been blocked for. She\u2019s crazy !!  My brother told my dad I made a police report & I haven\u2019t heard anything since, but my dad also excused her behavior again saying \u201cyou know how she is\u201d. So I\u2019m no longer speaking to them. I will never allow her around my children. But I hate that I\u2019m losing my dad over this b*tch. ",

I am completely on my own financially, my mom drained my college savings when she divorced my dad (who was abusive, I don\u2019t talk to him) so I\u2019m currently living off what money I make from my internship and a part time side job. Both of my bosses are largely out of the office these past two weeks so I\u2019ve only been having to go in during the afternoons, which has been great (I\u2019m in CS, so working remotely is common). My entire family has me on Life360, but for some reason last week it wasn\u2019t updating and was showing me at work when I wasn\u2019t, at home when I wasn\u2019t, etc. I kept getting daily texts from my mom asking me about work and why Life360 wasn\u2019t working. I ended up just deleting the app and figured I\u2019d try to fix it over the weekend when I had more free time.\n\nEvery. single. one. of my family members texted me this weekend panicking over my location. Mind you, they can all still see my location this entire time on Find My Friends, just not Life360. So the only thing that\u2019s different is that they aren\u2019t getting notifications when I leave my apartment, get to work, leave work, return to my apartment, etc. It honestly just confirmed to me that I didn\u2019t want this app on my phone anymore. I\u2019m a good kid, pay all my bills, never gotten in trouble with the law, never snuck out as a kid or did anything nefarious.

I\u2019ll admit, I had a lot of things pent up that kind of came out during this exchange. Still, I don\u2019t think I was particularly out of line, especially given our history.

        "Background": "I am 23(f)  \nMy uncle (40s) has lived in a different city or state for most of my life so we didn\u2019t spend  a whole lot of time together when I was growing up. But when he visited he used to always tell me I was his favorite. He would constantly challenge me to push myself. Wether it was hiking, or an opportunity for competition, or anything of the sort. He always knew exactly how to get me to do my best. He lives a few hundred miles away and drives up for family functions such as holidays. Everything changed 2 years ago at a family function when I announced my pregnancy to the family. My uncle stood up and walked out of the house without a word he just left. Later on he had asked me to help him build his cabin and I agreed. I was early in the pregnancy about 3 months. I knew he wasn\u2019t happy about it but I had faith that if he wasn\u2019t ready to talk that he wouldn\u2019t bring it up.  It was very quiet for a while and then he started talking, \u201cI would say congratulations, but I\u2019m not going to lie to you. I\u2019m not happy for you\u201d. He proceeded to talk about all of my mothers faults and mistakes and paint himself as the hero who swooped in to save the day. He said my mother was not fit to be a mother and that he offered to pay for her to get her tubes tied. He then said he has to many responsibilities to be there to take responsibility for my child. At this point I was already in tears and couldn\u2019t say much of anything. I was simply standing there pregnant and sobbing as he continued saying horrible things. I\u2019m not fit to be a mother\u2026 I should give my child up for adoption\u2026. etc. At no point did I ask him for help, or his input of any kind. I did not need his help I was in love with the fact that I was creating life and I was going to be a momma. He simply decided I was destined to be a horrible mother and drilled into me how terrible it was that I was pregnant.  Standing there in a partially built dry cabin, I felt paralyzed between the hormones and the conversation I had no idea what to do. When he brought up adoption I told him \u201cthis is my child, my responsibility and I will love, protect ,and provide for him no matter what.\u201d He took that as an opportunity to try to talk me out of keeping my baby. Important to note that he and I hadn\u2019t spent time together in years. Our last meaningful time spent together was when I was around the age of 10. He didn\u2019t know any details of my life or have any idea the person I had become. Outside of saying hello and good bye at family gatherings, we haven\u2019t talked in years. I cut contact with him and haven\u2019t spoken to him other than a few text messages. Only because he decided to message me \u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day\u201d\nThis year he sent a gift for me and my son, I was upset that he would try to act so nonchalantly after an itaction like that. It has been 2 years since that aweful interaction. However he never once attempted to apologize or acknowledge that he over stepped. I returned the gifts to him with a not that reads \u201cNo Thank You\nI dont Feel it is appropriate for me to accept a gift for myself and my child from someone who doesn\u2019t believe I am equipped to be a mother.\u201d\nI was stuck on what I should do because I don\u2019t want him thinking he can speak to me and treat me that way and we can just move on with no reconciliation. But I also felt petty for returning the gift, and I don\u2019t want family rifts or drama. I\u2019m not sure what the right move was in that situation I just knew I did not feel comfortable accepting grifts from someone who was so insistent i would fail. Especially a gift for my son who he insisted I must give up for adoption\u2026.\nAnyway AIO???",

The problem is that I am setting a boundary with you by saying no, but you continue to push it. My answer remains the same, please respect that. This isn't about the number of guests now...as about teaching me a lesson and putting me in check. You don't know how much this hurts me. I had already set my guest list beforehand. As I had said before, you did not give me the opportunity to give input on the guest list. I expressed to you that it was making me uncomfortable and as if I was being guilted and forced to do it.

Things have been tense for a while, especially after my recent health issues and surgery and battle with two severe bouts of ppd. We're not perfect and don't claim to be, we work at our marriage. He has a temper and a tendency to get aggressive and has had a couple of instances of being physical with me, even when I was pregnant a few years ago. He can be intimidating I guess.\n\nThere\u2019s a pattern that\u2019s been really confusing me. In all honesty, I was unfaithful years ago during a tough time in our marriage and I definitely hurt things and have been apologetic and working very hard to repair our marriage and trust. We aren't perfect by any means, just want to set the stage there. \n\nWhen he gets mad, he throws my past mistakes back in my face, which I can almost understand, but after doing that first time I set a boundary and said if we are going to move past this, it can't be a weapon you hand me every time you're mad. But it's happened several times now. \n\nUsually after these arguments, he sends these overly sweet, rambling messages that sound comforting but don\u2019t actually take accountability I feel like. They\u2019re full of contradictions and confusing explanations that leave me doubting my memory or wondering if I misunderstood everything. When I call it out, he says things like he doesn\u2019t recall saying it or that it was \u201cunintentional\u201d or a \"trigger.\u201d\n\nAs stated, I recently had surgery, quit nicotine, and have been a mess without much support and left to take care of most things on my own with 2 toddlers in the home (our 3rd child is in college out of town). We had another argument and this time, after the usual insults were hurled at my lack of being a good wife in the past, I lost it and just felt done with it all. I don't know how to be more sorry or change my past. I really do regret hurting him in that way but I can't take this emotional warfare. \n\nI finally found the courage to tell him that this feels manipulative and emotionally exhausting and that his apologies always feel like deflection. I told him I\u2019m drained and want to move toward healing separately, focusing on coparenting peacefully for our kids. \n\nHe replied with another long message that was basically word salad and told me to \u201cgive myself grace.\u201d Huh? \n\nAm I overreacting? I am post surgical, body is rebalancing a lot after a tumor I had removed and I quit smoking so I'm sure I could be losing my shit or making things worse.

        "Background": "So my sister's bf is very manipulative and he uses people alot. If my sister needs something he'll get on me about it and expect me to drop what I'm doing no natter what to help her. But If she needs something from him then he always makes her out to be the problem no matter what and then because he doesn't feel like helping he'll say \"go get your brother to help im not helping you\". Meanwhile I'm actually busy.\n\n\n\nShe texted me one night while I was at work asking me for a favor because he wouldn't help her. Because I have responsibilities and I have to make sure I can pay my rent on time and have enough money to take care of my well being i asked her why he can't help her. \n\n\n\n\nI asked that cause ever since I moved in he never helps her just because he doesn't feel like it and then he tells her to ask me to do it.  There was a morning where I got home after working my 12 hour shift and all I had time to was take a 5 min shower, hurry up and eat some food, and get my ass to sleep so I could get enough sleep for work. Her bf was sitting in the br on his phone watching reels and he knew he had nothing to do but he started manipulating me and guilt tripping me into bringing the garbage cans to the street which would've tooken me like 10 minutes because of the way everything was set into place in that neighborhood. He was trying to use me even tho I had my own responsibilities while he knew he didnt have anything to do that morning. And yes my schedule was so tight that I couldn't bring those garbages to the street. He knew that but he didn't care cause if he doesn't feel like doing it then he won't do it\n\n\nShe didn't give me a clear answer so I assumed he was just saying no because he didn't feel like it and wanted to use me so he could smoke weed instead(based on his patterns in the past). So I told her that unless he can't take her due to an emergency then Im not taking her. You may be asking \"why would u do that? That's your sister. Why would u say these things\".it's because he has no job and he just stays home all day and I have my own responsibilities and have to make sure I can take care of my rent and my own well being and knowing that he has patterns of using people if I just decide to be mr yes man then he's gonna think its OK to use me  and it's gonna be a weekly thing.\n\nThe fact that she didn't tell me why proves that she may have been scared that if she told me then he would've been mad cause then his self image would be at jeopardy since he's the one who always tells me to go out of my way for my sister.\n\n\nI promise you if it was an emergency I would've helped her. I wanted to help her anyways. But I can't let him think that it's OK to use me and for it to get worse.",

He is a rainbow baby for my husband and I after almost 5 years of trying to have a child; we are both older and the oldest siblings in our respective families.  I made it very clear to my family that I did not want their children to meet mine until he was around 6 weeks old, which would be around Easter this year.  My sister has three children, 8f, 5m, 2f, and my brother has one, 3m.  My husband has a niece and nephew from his brother but they are high school age.\n\nLast weekend I called my mother to let her know I wanted to drop off some Corningware from my brother's wife so she could pick it up; my brother works nearby and it is much closer than going to my brother's house.  My mom said to come by in the early afternoon after the local St. Patrick's Day parade had passed.  I made sure to let her know I did want want to come if she was going to have my siblings and their children present.  She reassured me they would not be there.\n\nMy husband and I arrive with baby in tow and my siblings vehicles are parked at my mom's house.  My heart sank.  My husband offered to take the Corningware inside, but I said, let's go and have a quick visit.  I held the baby the entire time and had everyone stay back, but when we left I realized I had been manipulated into this meeting and broke down on the way home.  My husband was also upset because my family has manipulated me in the past and spent a lot of my pregnancy ignoring me even when I provided them with positive updates.\n\nI sent them a strong text in our group chat a couple days after the incident and got a tepid apology from my mom and series of immature reactions from my brother.  My sister has remained silent and has only sent pictures of her cat, children, and an iNotes memo about their upcoming Easter event that I can't access because I have had Android for the past 15 years.  I blocked my brother's number after he sent more nonsense and have gray rocked my mom after she asked about my baby and my Easter plans.\n\nAm I overreacting by not going to Easter?  I only want to go because of my nieces and nephews.  My husband will do whatever I decide, but I know he's tired of me being disrespected and backhandedly insulted at every family event.  I have a bit of a trauma bond with my mom and siblings after a strict upbringing by our father (he and my mother divorced almost 20 years ago.). At this point I know I have to protect my child from my family.  I've always been the punching bag and I don't want that for my child.\n\nI have attached the screenshots of my text to the group chat.  Edited for anonymity.",

I was so anxious, in pain, tired etc last thing I wanted was some stranger washing up private areas. It can be very uncomfy for a number of reasons. Because they want to justify this repulsive behavior in their echo chamber is my guess. Is this how you talk about your patients? Doesn\u2019t this break the rule of being respectful?

        "Background": "I (17f) got a few messages today from my (kind of) friend (16m) on instagram. They were all instagram reals that was the type of stuff that a boyfriend would send to his girlfriend. We weren\u2019t even talking or anything he just sent them to me out of nowhere.\n\nI put them in this post in order of what was sent to me on instagram, and the whole thing felt really weird to me because: \na) we haven\u2019t talked since September of last year\nb) I\u2019ve graduated from the school and am started college in August\nc) I LIKE GIRLS. AND HE KNOWS THAT.\n\nI was trying to wrap my head around it before he sent the 4th picture and it made my skin crawl, and i immediately sent to him that I was uncomfortable, that I thought it was weird, reminded him that I\u2019m about to turn 18 next month, and told him not to contact me. He\u2019s blocked on every platform I can remember that he\u2019s on.\n\nSome extra context for my reaction is that he is notorious for asking random girls for nudes and cheating on his girlfriends. One of my friends was with him and he cheated on her, and I yelled at him over that in fact. The September we last talked in? He was telling me about how another relationship fell through and I talked to the person and they informed me that he was asking girls for nudes AGAIN. He wouldn\u2019t even be \u2018talking\u2019 to the girls he asks nudes from he would just be friends with them and then ask.\n\nI also never got any kind of hint that he ever was attracted to me in the first place because, you know, WE NEVER TALK. The most we talked throughout the school year was a simple hi or hello in the hallways and that was it. Last time we were actively talking to each other was when I was a sophomore and he was a freshman.\n\nIdk my friend and my parents say it\u2019s weird but did I overreact here?",

        "Background": "Throwaway account because I don\u2019t really use Reddit, but I could use some different perspectives. I (20F) just finished working my seasonal position at a haunted house. This is my second year at this attraction (which is on a farm) and I\u2019m super close with almost all of my coworkers. This year, we had some of the farmhands join us to chase guests with chainsaws. Most of the chainsaw guys are Mexican (the attraction is in Canada), with varying levels of English language ability.\n\nOne of the chainsaw guys, who I\u2019ll call Miguel, was part of my section of the house this year. He\u2019s probably in his 40s and speaks practically no English, but I speak LatAm Spanish at about a B1-B2 level so we could still communicate. Miguel was very nice to me and my other friend in our part of the house, we often danced and goofed around while waiting for guests, or played pranks by scaring each other/throwing balloons at each other. I\u2019d bring him water and candy for the long nights, and we all got along really well.\n\nOn our last night of the season, I was walking back to the barn where we all get ready for each night after grabbing my stuff from the attraction, around 11pm. Miguel was waiting for me in the parking lot. We talked for a bit, exchanged numbers so I could send him some of the pictures I\u2019d taken during the haunt, all very normal conversation.\n\nThen he said he wanted to kiss me. I was completely taken aback by this, and repeated what he said multiple times to make sure I\u2019d heard him right (he talks very fast and is usually wearing a balaclava under his scary mask so sometimes it\u2019s tough to understand him). He said that he asked because didn\u2019t want me to get angry, so he didn\u2019t force me or anything. But I was still reeling a bit so I asked him to clarify again. He put his hands on my cheeks and drew me forward a bit, so I stepped away and said no. He didn\u2019t push me or anything and didn\u2019t ask again, but I was still rattled by the whole thing. Emotions were running high from the end of the haunt season, I was exhausted, and I was hungry, so I didn\u2019t want to assume the worst and start freaking out.\n\nThe thing is, I know a lot of Latin Americans are very physically affectionate. Miguel would often pat me on the back, flick away pieces of my wig out of my face, and lightly poke my chin/face. We had another Mexican guy in our attraction who was also very playful and hugged us a lot. However, he was 25 (much closer to our ages, as most of the actors are 16-30) and spoke some English, so the cultural/generational gap wasn\u2019t as wide.\n\nI want to give Miguel the benefit of the doubt, like maybe it was a paternal sort of affection that just crossed a cultural line? It\u2019s important to note that he knows I am much younger than him AND that I\u2019m a lesbian. I was also the only actor who spoke any Spanish, so we bonded more than he did with my other coworkers. He\u2019s also texted me since last night and his messages are just friendly from what I\u2019m perceiving, but obviously Spanish is not my first language so I\u2019m worried I might be missing his full intention (messages are attached). I\u2019m not planning to respond anymore because I\u2019m feeling a bit uncomfortable. Is this whole thing weird or am I overreacting?",

I hate him for my guts. \n\nRecently, my aunt got me a baby parrot. She was kept in my aunt's house but a week ago, my aunt needed to go out of station. I hesitantly brought her over to my house. Everything went well, my parents were actually loving and caring for the parrot when I was gone. It's hot in my country and we have to keep our fans switched off so that my parrot doesn't get hurt. My father complains about it a lot but we just advice him to stay locked in the bedroom so that my parrot can fly and remain free(I never locked her in a cage). \n\nToday, I was getting ready for school. The living room's fan was switched on and my parrot was locked in my room. My father went into my room for something and left the door WIDELY open. She flew out and got hit by the fan. I couldn't even stop crying. She struggled so much and was bleeding a hell lot. I scooped her into my arms to rush her to a vet but she laid her head on my palm and died as soon as I picked her up. I was devastated. \n\nMy father? He didn't give a sh-t. He yelled at me to get ready fast and forcefully sent me to school. The teachers sent me back because I was inconsolable to which he called me and idiot and mocked me for crying. I spent the whole afternoon crying and refusing to eat anything. I buried her with my own hands under a tree she loved to sit on. Back in the evening, I got ready to go out for fresh air and to calm my mind when he started mocking me again. So, I yelled at him and wished that he'd died instead of my parrot. I told him that he was responsible for her death and he should f-ck off from my life. \n\nHe got all mad and defensive about it but idc. He deserves to die for everything he did. He not only abuses me and my mother but also is the reason why the one thing that provided me happiness in my life died. \n\nI've attached a picture of her. She was so adorable. I'm so sorry baby, I hope you will always be happy wherever you are. I love you and I'll always miss you.\n",

For years, my family would tell me the relationship was toxic and unhealthy, and honestly, it was. He\u2019d leave me stranded on the side of the road during arguments. When I tried to break up with him, he\u2019d flat-out say he\u2019d kill himself. When I did get the strength to block him and attempt to go no contact, he\u2019d have his friends or sister harass me until I unblocked him. Still, stupidly, I loved him.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I was scared as hell to tell my family. But when I did, my mom supported me after being pissed for like three days. Of course, throughout the pregnancy, my relationship with my baby daddy was at its absolute lowest. I saw him a total of three times, and within the last month, he all of a sudden wanted to be \u201cinvolved.\u201d I just went along with it.

Not long after he moved out, I did too. After he moved out, for the limited days I was there, she did quit drinking as much, but I still felt like I didn\u2019t know how to act around her. She was nice.\n\nAnyway, I moved out and started living with a friend of mine. We were both still in high school and her family knew I was moving in. They were ok with it. They took me in, fed me, clothed me, helped me with starting my life. I did have a job so I paid for most of my stuff. I was finically starting to be happy where I am in life and stopped stressing as much as to what was going to happen and if something did happen. \n\nI moved out of my friends not long after because I moved in with my boyfriend. We are renting and I am even happier than before. I was actually starting a life for myself and his family is also there if we needed anything. \n\nDuring this time I never really talked to my mom because she was mad at me and we never got to talk through how we were feelings and such. I saw her every now and again and we were friendly, and it was nice. I felt like we could have actually started to have a relationship again. \n\nThe family that I moved in with, both the parents passed away. Which is really sad, obviously. And my mom was worried for me and such but nothing really came out of it. We were still friendly. Now my mom is threatening the family because I am in the obituary of the parents and says gonna try and do legal action.  The parents were really nice and they always said I am like one of their children. I was happy because it made me not feel as guilty that I am taking space in their house and that I was actually welcomed. It made me happy when they said I was their child and the siblings accepted me. (I\u2019ve known my friend since 4th grade but really knew the family not long after that). The kids wrote me as one of the children of the parents, which made me happy and I did not care. \n\nBut now my mom is pissed that is happening. \n(I feel like this is not out of line for my mom though because she refused to let me see my boyfriend because I was in ONE family photo of theirs)\n\nIf needed more context let me know, I\u2019m sorry if I did not explain well.\n\n\n ",

There\u2019s a park across the street, but conveniently enough there\u2019s these huge rocks placed right at the edge of the park where people could turn and hit if they don\u2019t stay on the street and jump the curb.\n\nNow, I live near the beach and constantly have people parking in the red zone on both sides of the alley. When people do this, trucks cannot make a turn out of the alley safely, but they will still try. And they are so focused on not hitting the illegally parked car that they hit the roof of my house. Only one time was I home and able to chase the truck down the alley. But  I\u2019ve spent thousands in repair to my house.\n\nI have no patience anymore and Los Angeles is actually terrible at ticketing in my area, and my neighbors and I will call several times. And sometimes I leave a note on their car calling them lazy entitled POS. Well, I did this to this one lovely lady. She comes back the next day and puts a note on my door and calls me entitled and that she parked there momentarily for a short bit (4 hours guys. I have cameras). I decided to take screen shots and print them and post her face on my door. My friends think I\u2019m unhinged, but I\u2019m just tired of the disrespect.\n\nWe even had a neighbor across the busy street try and spray paint the red zone gray because he felt it should be a parking spot \ud83d\ude2d",

        "Background": "I moved back home about a year ago inspite of me and my parent's differing world views because 1) it was good for me financially and 2) they're in their '80s and are starting to need more help. (I'm in my thirties but was adopted). We get along enough that it's a win-win. \n\nInspite of my dad and I each believing that the other is completely brainwashed, we still try to get along and see the good in each other. \n\nAnyway, \n\nI had a sudden craving to watch A Goofy Movie and thought it would be a good chance to spend some neutral quality time with him. Knowing him as I do I thought he would enjoy watching it. \n\nWe were sitting down to watch the movie when he found out that...gasp... A Goofy Movie would cost $3.99 to rent on YouTube!! That's when he refused to watch it with me. \n\nI told him I'm going to pay that money and watch it with or without him, and he insisted I watch it without him because of the price. \n\nI tried to point out that we've gone to the movie theaters before, he buys random crap on eBay and hundreds of books at thrift stores that he's never going to read, that $4 isn't a lot to spend on some quality time but he absolutely refused citing that he doesn't want to pay for it. I'm an adult with my own money and I'm going to pay for it, but no that wasn't good enough. \n\nIt honestly hurts my feelings. \n\nSo now instinct is to want to not let him live it down for a whike. Tease him about it in front of people, say things like \"$4 is too high of a price for some quality time with your own daughter\" get four $1 bills and say do you choose this or do you choose me? That's a trick question you chose this and then rip up the dollar bills. \n\nMaybe I won't do something that theatrical but I just feel like I don't want to let him live this down for a while. Maybe he just didn't want to watch this particular movie and saw his chance to get out of it. I highly doubt he was trying to get out of spending time with me personally, but this refusal over the $4 is honestly bizarre to me. \n\nAm I overreacting? ",

They are both mid-forties. He is supposedly a successful businessman\u2014I have never met him. They dated for 4 years. \n\nI attached screenshots with names and private info redacted.

Her father had died just before they met. He exploits her grief to create doubt and control her. He\u2019d call her \u201cstupid\u201d because she didn\u2019t go to college, and when they broke up told her he \u201calways wanted to be with a woman with a college degree\u201d anyway. \n\nToday I got concerned when she texted me: \u201cHe is so toxic. He once said he almost hired a hot guy to kill someone who challenged his business but had to talk himself out of it. If I die in a weird way, follow that lead.\u201d Then, \u201cIf seriously, though, if anything happens to me, you slander his name and make him known to all newspapers like he\u2019s such a high business man that he tries to protect his reputation\u2026 If anything happens to me page 6, just get his name out there and ruin him\u201d\n\nAIO for saying she needs an Order of Protection?\n\nShe seems too overwhelmed and confused as to whether or not she should even block his number right now.

He didn't respond to my message, so I rushed through work to hurry home and make supper so we weren't stuck eating after 8pm. This is the message I received back. I dont have the money to buy myself meals and he knows this. We don't have very much fast/quick stuff in the house, so I would have had to cook something. I figured I would just have a sandwich, too, but got home and found he had eaten 3 sandwiches which left me without bread. I ended up not eating at all yesterday and just went to bed early. I'm upset because to me, it felt like it didn't matter to him if I had food or not. It felt like I didn't matter and like he didn't think of or care about my wellbeing. I don't know if this was sheer laziness. He was playing COD when I arrived, so maybe he didn't want to cook because it would take away time from his game. I cried myself to sleep last night because I felt so abandoned in the moment. Idk why it hit me so hard, but it did. So AIO? ",

        "Background": "\n\n\n\n*Okay so to start off I\u2019m now in my freshmen yr of highschool..this whole situation happened over summer break*\n\n\nOver the summer I was able to go on a school trip to NY. It was really fun don\u2019t get me wrong!  Until it wasn\u2019t.\n\nOn this trip it was separated into incoming freshmen (I just finished 8th at the time) and was also a mixture of ppl in 9th.\n\nWe got there and were first in Washington D.C. before heading over to NYC.\n\nI was having a great time with my friends who were also on the trip when we ran into an old friend of theirs.\n\nWe\u2019ll call him Trevor, I personally didn\u2019t know him personally. However I would see him around when I was in 7th.\n\nHey later joined us in the many touristy areas of our trip and later started talking to me a lot more often, I didn\u2019t really think much until we got back into a bus that would have us in there for about 2-3 hrs to drive to NYC.\n\n\nI remember waiting for my friend (we\u2019ll call her Melanie)\n\nI waited for a while since I was one of the few people to get on and because of that I put on my headphones and closed my eyes resting my head on the window, Yk just listening to music.\n\nAfter a while I felt someone sit next to me, to my surprise it was Trevor. I immediately got up to go sit next to my friend thinking he probably wanted to sit where I sat.\n\nHe stopped me and from then I had to sit with him because we were \u201crunning late already\u201d \n\nHe tried to make small talk but I felt really uncomfortable, especially since he\u2019s older and I didn\u2019t know him that well.\n\nHe later put on a movie and offered for me to watch, during that time my phone had just died so I thought \u201cmight as well\u201d\n\nNear the middle of the movie, which I can\u2019t remember the name came a funny part.\n\nThis is kinda where things started to feel really weird.\n\nAfter the funny part had passed he slapped his hand on my thigh and started rubbing it up and down. \n\nImmediately I froze and brought my legs closer to myself, which didn\u2019t do anything because I was sitting in the window spot while he occupied the aisle seat.\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything though because I was scared an altercation would occur and I would end up ruining the trip for everyone.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s when I messed up,\n\nOver the next few days he kept sitting next to me, occasionally rubbing my thigh and knee. It made me really uncomfortable, and I hate how I didn\u2019t defend myself, I feel as it was my fault because then he started doing something else.\n\nHe started to push me up against the glass when I would say something to him like, how it made me uncomfortable or when I would tell him to stop.\n\nHe would force down my hands against my chest so that they were on my chest and then he would push down so I was all up against the glass.\n\nWhile visiting tourist attractions he would follow me around and because of that I would walk very close to my friends. Any time I got.\n\nWhile there we stopped by to watch the Show \u201cHamilton\u201d it was amazing, and thankfully we had a singed seats. His FARRRR away from mine.\n\nOne of my teachers who I used to think was really intimidating sat behind me.\n\nI zoned out for a bit waiting for the play to start when I felt someone tap my shoulder. I turned my head and my teacher asked me \u201cHey, is Trevor making you uncomfortable?\u201d She paused glancing over at him \u201cI know you have never been the confrontational type, but if he is bothering you then you can tell me\u201d\n\nI regret not telling her..\n\nI reluctantly smiled at her saying she had nothing to worry about because I was afraid Trevor would hurt me.\n\nAfter I got back to the hotel we were staying at my friends and and I all started our nightly routines, getting ready to go to bed.\n\nWhen one of my friends who ill nickname miffy, asked me \u201care you and Trevor dating?\u201d\n\nI shook my head and asked why \n\n\u201cWell I overheard him arguing with \u2018Alex\u2019 for the seat next to you\u201d\n\nI felt my heart drop, I knew it\u2019s not like he did that much to me but it still felt scary.\n\nShe later explained that she was standing behind them and that he was willing to pay $100 for the ticket next to me. I never thought I would hear something like that. It made me sick, and that\u2019s when I later told them everything, how I felt, what he did to me and more.\n\nAnother one of my friends later spoke up saying \u201cYeah, when we visited Times Square he tried to cover your eyes and say \u2018guess who??\u2019 But the teacher (who sat behind me in Hamilton) stopped him saying \u201cNO TREVOR, SHE IS TOO YOUNG FOR YOU!\u201d \n\nIt sucked hearing that come out of her mouth, it made me realize so many things could have happened to me and I didn\u2019t even know. I wonder if I could have even prevented the whole incident.\n\nThat night all the girls I was staying with in that room vowed to protect me the next day as it was our last before we went home that afternoon. \n\nI remember waking up, feeling a sense of dread but relief. We went downstairs for breakfast but saw him going to the elevator so I stayed back with Miffy while Melanie who was close to him told him to stay away from me.\n\nMelanie later told me it was safe to come out and for the whole day I felt his eyes on me.\n\nI felt his eyes on me the whole day, even occasionally giving me a sad look. One of my guy friends asked what happened between us because we seemed \u201cso close throughout the whole trip\u201d I told him we weren\u2019t.\n\nI later on got these texts:\n(Check photos in top of post)\n\nIt was weird because he said what he did was wrong and admitted to it in private how he overstep boundaries. But when it came to my friend groups photos he acted like he didn\u2019t know.\n\nFast forward to leaving (In the airport) my friend Melanie said that he said, and I quote \u201cI felt safe with (me) and None understands me like her (still talking abt me)\u201d\n\nAlthough this made me uncomfortable and feel sick to death I was happy I would get rid of him as we boarded on the plane.\n\nFor the last 3 weeks left of summer he tried to get in contact with me through instagram/Snapchat.\n\nIt got so bad I asked my sister for help and she texted him to stay away from me. He got mad and defensive and we blocked him.\n\nI guess that\u2019s where it ends. I feel guilty, I feel I could have done more to help myself and I didn\u2019t. Maybe it was because I was wearing tank tops there, I\u2019m not sure..\n\nI wish I wasn\u2019t so unlucky\n\nI had past experiences with weird guys but Trevor was different, I\u2019ve been having nightmares constantly I can\u2019t even sleep anymore. I have these nightmares where Trevor and I are still in the bus and he takes it too far and gR@pes me. \n\nBut he didn\u2019t really do anything wrong, so am I in the wrong? \n\nI see him everyday at school and he always gets close to me when there is so much space between us. I don\u2019t know what to do. Am I over exaggerating?\n\nI probably am. Let me know what you guys think and if you need more details on what happened, I wasn\u2019t clear enough I think.\n\n-Also if you have advice for how to get at least a full 8 hrs of sleep let me know! I usually get 2-3 hrs now and it\u2019s really exhausting and hard to not sleep just so I don\u2019t get those bad dreams of him.-\n",

        "Background": "On Thursday of last week I saw a post needing medical professionals to come down and volunteer for the Kerrville flood relief efforts, so I asked my boss if I could take the weekend off and go help, to which he said yes. My plan was to leave Friday after work and take a 4 hour road trip to stay near the nonprofit in Austin and spend all of Saturday/Sunday volunteering with them. One of my best friends of 12 years just so happens to live there, so when I decided to go she was the first I called to see if we could make plans, and she invited me to stay with her so I won\u2019t have to pay for a hotel/airbnb for 2 nights. \n\nFor context: The past year she\u2019s really disappointed me as a best friend. We\u2019ve always stayed connected even though we\u2019ve been extremely busy with school, and I worked full time through all of undergrad so there weren\u2019t many opportunities to visit except for when she came in town or I happened to travel to Austin. The last year, she came to visit her family where I live TWICE without telling me/making plans. The first time I noticed she was here, I made plans to hangout with her, to which she post-poned every 2 hours before cancelling because she was \u201chaving so much anxiety about having to get an oil change\u201d\u2026 of course that pissed me off because she wasted my entire day when I turned down other plans just for her to know she\u2019s gonna end up canceling. We met up later and she apologized and expressed how she would never want to let me down and still really wanted to see me. Fast forward a few months and she comes down again without telling me, and when I text, she says \u201cI leave tomorrow\ud83d\ude2d,\u201d mind you she was here for a week without ever reaching out. Of course that hurt me, but I tried to let it go because I thought maybe I\u2019m being self-centered and she had other priorities. After I ignore her text about leaving the next day, she proceeds to text me \u201cwhen I get my first big girl paycheck can I pay for your gas money to drive down and visit me?\ud83e\udd79,\u201d which I also ignore because it\u2019s completely inconsiderate\u2014I\u2019ve had my \u201cbig girl\u201d job for 4 years, and have a family of 3 that rely on me, and an established routine full of responsibilities and no paid time off\u2026 it\u2019s a lot easier for her single self that relies on parents to come visit me than me to drop everything at once and drive down to stay with her and her 5 roommates. \n\nNow back to the weekend visit: Since I called her Thursday we were talking about how excited we were to go out to dinner together and have our coffee dates back for the weekend, and catch up on life and her new bf of 4 months!! Then as I\u2019m leaving Friday evening after working an 11 hour shift, I get a text from her that her friend is coming in town the same weekend last minute and her and her roommates want to celebrate her birthday. Turns out the girl isn\u2019t just \u201ccoming into town,\u201d she literally lives there year-round and is home from visiting her parents\u2026 yet they still decide her birthday plans HAVE to be this Saturday despite my best friend making plans with me Sat evening. I\u2019m thinking damn that sucks, but I like making friends and celebrations so maybe this will be great! I arrive to her house and no one besides my friend greets me, introduces themselves to me, or even acknowledges my presence unless we happen to run into each other in the hall and they\u2019re forced to give an awkward \u201cHi I\u2019m ____ before walking away\u201d. All of Friday night my friend is expressing to me \u201cidk what the plans are for tomorrow because they\u2019re so last minute\u201d and keeps reiterating \u201cidk they\u2019re so last minute\u201d all the way up to Sat evening, when she begins saying \u201cI just gee bad like what are you gonna do,\u201d which makes me realize IM NOT INVITED, despite us having plans first and this birthday party being planned after my trip to stay with them (and I\u2019m not even with her during the day! I\u2019m literally out saving lives and only wanted to see her sat morning/evening if possible). It\u2019d be one thing if it were a pre-planned event with RSVPs or reservations, but no, they got a fcng cake and all pre-gamed and sang happy birthday downstairs while I was literally upstairs in her room ALONE. Then they go to the bar\u2014again, without inviting me whatsoever\u2014and proceed to stay out from 10pm-1:30am, thus leaving me no time to see my friend who I\u2019m literally staying with. They come home from the bar and I\u2019m kept up until 3 am with their drunk, loud selves while I\u2019m locked away in her room like a peasant\u2026 they also all know I have to wake up early again to, ya know, save lives. I obviously go to sleep and wake up really upset. I have never felt so left out and unwanted in my life. I would NEVER EVER EVER let one of my girls feel left out like that, ESPECIALLY if they are driving 4 hours to stay with me after I MADE the offer. I\u2019m honestly heartbroken, and it really hurt me that our friendship of over a decade was no where near worth her adjusting plans with her new besties of one year. \n\nI\u2019m really beginning to question our friendship and if it\u2019s worth me even entertaining or addressing this situation with her, as I said the past year has been filled with of disappointment. \n\nMy question: Am I overreacting?? Am I being self-centered, or was this actually kind of cruel? \n\nThe picture is of our last few texts, and I still have yet to reply to her message from yesterday because I\u2019m honestly just upset and don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nTLDR: My best friend of over 12 years invited me to stay at her house for the weekend with her 5 roommates and they all threw a last minute birthday party and went to the bar without inviting me, even though those plans were made after everyone knew I was coming to stay. AIO for being heartbroken and not knowing how/if I should bring it up to her? I have yet to reply to her messages. ",

They were never flirty and were usually pretty short. The screencaps are below, so you can judge for yourself, but I'm nervous that he's trying to ask me out or something.\n\n I know my ex would be pissed even though I'm not interested in this guy at all. They aren't super close with each other, but they have been in the same d&d group since 2016 and do game nights together almost every week. In one of his texts, he asks me to call him when I got home. I never told him I went out, so I assume he saw it on my Instagram, but he doesn't follow me. To be fair, he was NEVER flirty with me before, so I may just be seeing something that isn't there, but it just seems so odd. Idk. Any thoughts?",

I\u2019ll try to keep it short. \n\nI am in a group chat with 3 of my friends from school, two men and one other woman. For context we are all between 26 and 31. One of the men, let\u2019s call him P is very politically oriented, he talks about it constantly and honestly sometimes he says stuff that has made me and a few other people uncomfortable. He often talks about women in a degrading way, saying stuff like \u00ab\u00a0she\u2019s not that hot, but with my d*ck in her mouth she wouldn\u2019t be too bad\u00a0\u00bb. Sht like that. \nThe girl sent a screenshot of funny comments from a tiktok video, for context it was the photo below. But this was what his response was : \n\nP : 1 out of 2 women is sexually unsatisfied, what do you want, I can\u2019t be everywhere at once lol Not my fault if they choose poorly. And the one who says she\u2019s the one doing all the work \u2014 in reality, it\u2019s the opposite. I\u2019ve lost count how many women are completely passive, not to mention the ones who just lie there like a starfish\u2026\n\nIf in most cases women say it wasn\u2019t great, you have to know that in many cases women don\u2019t do much during sex.\n\nAnd as a final jab, a lot of them should learn how to give head. For many, the performance is insufficient \ud83d\ude02 it\u2019s not just my opinion many men agree with me\u2026\n\nWhich imo was completely uncalled for, I just answered something like lmao damn why are you being bitter I think it was just a joke, to which he started going on about how women have wayy more choice than men and get to f who they want but men don\u2019t have that \"privilege\", and added that women also complain a lot about men but always chose the \"bad boy\" and the they can\u2019t be blamed for our poor choice in men. (it\u2019s giving the nice guy) \nLiterally sent like two paragraphs saying how women never chose men of lower social status than them and men choose women who they find prettier. Oh and we don\u2019t get dressed up and do makeup for ourselves but because it is to seduce and manipulate men. It is \"biological and hormonal\" and goes on about social pressures men have. \n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, of course I agree there are inequalities and social problems for everyone and it IS a problem and obviously there are men and women who do think like or act like this, but I can\u2019t help but feel that this was uncalled for it had nothing to do with what was sent in the first place and also kinda borderline creepy things to say ? \nI\u2019ve been thinking about cutting off our friendship as I feel our morals don\u2019t align, and I say them because I tried talking to the other girl in the group about it in private but she always answer that it\u2019s \"just a joke\" and that I\u2019m over reacting bc deep down he\u2019s a good guy.

I asked what was going on, he basically felt disillusioned with our relationship as we hadn't had sex in a while ( I have pcos, and a very low libido, I also have problems with my knees which can affect sex positions a lot, I have also gained around 6 stone in the years we have been dating (but slowly due to knee ops etc), I know I should be making more effort, but so could he tbh) so we talked and not much happened. \n\nAbout a week later I again noticed he was on the phone a lot, and saw him on our garden camera having a conversation and looking happy, but i just had a gut feeling something wasn't right, I went outside to see his reaction, he immediately hung up and went to go indoors, I asked why he stopped the call, he said oh its nothing etc, he came back out and I pointedly asked who he was talking to, it was a 17 year old girl from work who had accused another co worker of acting inappropriate, and she was having a hard time so he was cheering her up, I was angry as I was/am dealing with my father passing away. We had an argument and I walked out and spoke with my mum on the phone. I came back and he profusely apologised. \n\nA few days later I noticed he's put his phone on silent and is again texting a lot, acting shady again, I again confront him and he says he has been flirting/sexting with someone, but won't say who. I assume the 17 yo, after a huge argument he tells me he found a lump in his testicle and think he may have cancer but hasn't done anything about it, and this was him getting the most out of life before anything happened.\n\nI made him a drs appointment the next day, and they think its most likely a cyst, but are sending for a scan to be sure.\n\nCouple of days later we are again having a serious talk as I have lost all trust, still dont know who he's actually been talking to, when he trips up and mentions snapchat, nothing really comes of the talk but I've said the last few times that the relationship has seemingly come to an end if he's so unhappy with me, and I'm not fulfilling his needs.\n\nThat night i remembered seeing a note book open when I previously  got home from work which rang some red flags and I took a picture of (attached).\n\n I went to work the next day and said texted him saying I'm still not happy and your still lying to me, and I want to know exactly who you've been talking to, and mentioned the attached notes.\n\nI came home to another talk, with the following take away; he's been flirting/sexting with the 17yo, but an ex work colleague (unknown age but assumed later 20's) got into contact with him months ago (this was his own admission), and he was flirting/sexting occasionally (once a week etc), and who the notes were about/aimed at, he ghosted her on WhatsApp and she has reached out again on snapchat and they have been carrying on on there instead (I did download snapchat but couldn't see him in my contacts import, dont know if I'm blocked as I did use it years ago but not for long, but I still have an account), i did say something more must be going on if he went to the effort of writing these notes, which are far from innocent in this context.\nHis main point is that he hasn't had sex with anyone or so he says. \n\nHe is a stoner, and becoming a heavy drinker, and plays computer games all day and doesn't really help with anything, won't plan anything etc. He's kissed an ex-colleague years ago and got too close with her. He also was in contact with an ex last year, who then threatened to kill herself, went missing, he got arrested and our home searched by police, I dont have a clue what actually happened with the ex, but there was no foul play on his part.\n\nI've said that he has emotionally cheated and lied by ommission, and that our sex life would have been ok when he started to message the ex-colleague, he also hadn't had the cancer scare at that point.\n\nHes allowed me to think I'm being paranoid, and has fat shamed me several times over the last few weeks.\n\nI have no idea what to do, how to process this, or even if i am really over reacting due to my dad's death, which is super hard to deal with, without all this other stuff going on.",

        "Background": "We technically met last year (and we go to the same gym) and hung out a couple of times, but I told him I wasn\u2019t interested in dating at the time since life got crazy. He blocked me on Instagram after that and I guess deleted my number? Then two weeks ago, he randomly slid back into my DMs and asked if we could catch up. He asked to go to a place walking distance from me and originally was going to pick me up on the way since it was raining. But he kind of switched it up when he arrived and asked to park in my building and walk since the rain stopped. \n\nAnyway during the \u201ccatch up,\u201d he asked if we could consider it a date. I said something like \u201cI guess it can be\u201d but also made it really clear verbally that I wasn\u2019t dating anyone right now and wasn\u2019t in the headspace of dating, and that if I were to date, it would need to be very slow since I\u2019ve just been enjoying my life, traveling, and seeing friends. For the rest of the date he kind of ignored that I said that and kept saying how glad he was that \u201cwe were on a date,\u201d and kept referencing being excited to keep getting to know each other and stuff. What made it feel weirder was that I found out he was in a relationship a few weeks earlier\u2026 it felt like he was overly eager given he was just dating someone else?\n\nSide note I also apologized at one point for backing away the year prior and he was like \u201cthat really hurt me\u2026.\u201d \ud83d\ude10 It was pretty strange and a little victim-y given we went on I think two or three dates total. It set a weird tone for me to kind of feel guilty? Idk haha but I apologized again with sincerity since he was sad about it for some reason. \n\nAnyway after dinner and drinks (around almost midnight) I said I was tired and it was time to head back so we went back to my floor where he parked and started saying (what I thought) were goodbyes. I realized once I buzzed into my gate and heard walking behind me that he followed me into my building without asking. He knew he did because he was like \u201cwait why am I following you?\u201d And I said \u201cI have no idea\u2026 \ud83d\udc40 \u201c but I added a haha to cut the tension. He asked to come inside for \u201ca few minutes.\u201d \n\nI sat as far away as possible on the couch and yawned a bit to signal that he should leave, and like 30 minutes in he said \u201c I really want to kiss you\u201d \ud83d\udc40 and stared. I said okay and kissed him for five seconds but it hit me how weird it all felt and I pulled away and immediately said \u201ctext me when you make it home\u201d and stared intensely with no emotion until he left. \n\nI guess my doubt kicked in and I texted him again the next day. After that he basically  started acting like a boyfriend, asking to pick me up from the airport and overly familiar things given we\u2019d only been on one date. That\u2019s when it felt like this was happening \u201cto me\u201d instead of with me and felt like I should cut it off. The screenshots are basically how that unfolded.\n\nI\u2019ve mostly been told I\u2019m right but a couple friends said maybe he was excited and just clueless? Am I over-reacting?\n\nPlease don\u2019t go viral I think he\u2019ll crash out if he sees this lol. ",

        "Background": "So I (26f) and my partner (27m) have been together for over two years and have got a mortgage together. Our relationship is literally great except we have a dead bedroom. He always makes excuses and has recently just flat out rejected me. It\u2019s annoying because he knows intimacy in a relationship is really important to me. He keeps saying he\u2019ll do better but never does. It\u2019s been over a year of this now. \n\nNow comes yesterday. I was in the shower and he said he needed one so I asked him to join me. At first he said there isn\u2019t enough room but there most definitely is. So then he said ok hang on I\u2019ll get in now. Then I proceeded to wait in the shower for a further 20 mins and got fed up. So I got out and found him ironing clothes for when he goes out later on. I admit I actually just cried because it\u2019s all the time and I feel so rejected. He found me crying and comforted me and was being really sweet. Then anyway he went to the city drinking with the boys and I went to go see my nephew. He told me to expect him home at 9pm. I don\u2019t keep track on him as I know he usually stays out later than the time he gives. He then rang me at 8:30 asking to get picked up from the train station but I said no as I had already told him when I come back from running errands I wanted a glass of wine and had already drank it as this point. He said no worries will get a taxi home. Anyway an hour or two later he rings and tells me he\u2019s waking home prob one of our local pubs which confused me as that\u2019s no where near the train station. I asked why he got dropped off there as it\u2019s still a 45 min walk to our house. He was then stuttering and ended up telling me he met a woman on the train who was heading there to meet her husband so he jumped in with her and had a drink with them. He didn\u2019t tell me the husband part until a phone call later so I found that a bit sus. So I believe he\u2019s walking home and 1.5 hours later he still isn\u2019t back when he definitely should have been so I got in my car and went out looking for him. I couldn\u2019t find him anywhere so drove back home and slowly went through the estate checking either pavement. A car ended up driving close behind and backed off at the bottom of our street around the corner. I parked up on our drive and got out to see him walking around that corner. So I knew he must\u2019ve been in that car otherwise I would have definitely seen him. He denies this profusely and won\u2019t tell me how he got home other than he walked. I know this ain\u2019t true as I drove the way home he would have walked. Anyway we get into an argument about it and I ask to see his phone (we never do this but I really didn\u2019t trust what he was telling me as he had just been missing for almost two hours) he said why and I said I wanted to check his last messages and any photos so he said no. His phone was on the bed so I picked it up and he got up and grabbed me trying to get the phone. BTW he has never once layed a finger on me and he\u2019s a pretty chill guy so I never see him angry. Anyway he was gripping me so I tried to run out of the room and then when I seen his face (it was like I didn\u2019t recognise him, just fuelled by anger) he grips my wrist and yanks me so hard that my face slammed into him and he put me in a headlock. I ended up just letting go of the phone as at this point I felt a sudden daunting clarity that he is definitely hiding something. He then said I\u2019m not crossing that boundary but he\u2019s willing to hurt me instead? I just think if he had nothing to hide and could easily prove his innocence and ease my mind why is it such a big deal? I slept in the spare room and have tried keeping away from him but he\u2019s acting as if nothing happened and when I said he scared me he\u2019s called me a drama queen. I am so confused as I thought our relationship was great minus the dead bedroom but now I think he\u2019s been cheating. But like I said he\u2019s acting like nothings happened and almost making me feel bad for him. AIO? ",

I don\u2019t mind supporting her financially, that\u2019s something I accepted.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: whenever something comes up, instead of asking, she demands that I pay for it, even when we\u2019re already juggling financial challenges. Recently, she\u2019s been pushing me about covering her dentist bills. It\u2019s not that I refuse to help\u2014I\u2019ve covered dental emergencies for her before and I want her to get the care she needs. What frustrates me is how she approaches it, like it\u2019s owed to her, without acknowledging the strain we\u2019re under or the fact that I\u2019m already carrying everything.\n\nFor example, I promised to gift her $2k for a car down payment to encourage her independence, but every time we save it, real-life emergencies force us to use it. She knows this, but now she\u2019s upset and pressing me on dental expenses like I\u2019m holding out on her.\n\nI\u2019d happily help if she came to me in a considerate way, but being spoken to like it\u2019s my sole responsibility, no discussion, makes me feel disrespected.\n\nSo, AIO for being annoyed at how she\u2019s asking, even though I\u2019m not refusing to help?",

        "Background": "Moved into a 4bed/3bath in July. 6 of us total on the lease (including myself). 2 couples who each take one bedroom. Roommates will be referred to as myself, J, S, L, G, and M. G\u2019s partner is N. Stick with me here.\nWe have all known each other upwards of 2 years. We decided to move in together on our last year or two of college (we are all 20-22) for cheap rent and fun nights. 6 people split $3300/mo + ~$200 utilities. The problem is that more than six people live here consistently.\nG and N have been together for ~4-6 months. The circumstances in which they got together are questionable but now is not the time. Here are the grievances:\n- When we moved in, they made N a copy of our house key. I expressed that I was not comfortable with someone who did not live here & had only been in a relationship with our roommate for less than 6 months having a key. They gave the key to S instead, but N would still sometimes enter our home when G was not with them. We found out N and G have just been using the same key set, so effectively, N still has a key.\n- N lives 2 blocks down, in the same neighborhood. They have not been to their home for more than 6 hours in one week in over a month. We have a Life360 circle so I am easily able to verify this.\n- N showers here, does laundry here, watches TV here, cooks here, etc. but does not pay anything for water, gas, electricity, and other utilities. They have only ever contributed to groceries once or twice.\n- On the topic of cooking, N has regularly meal prepped 2 weeks worth of food for themselves, G, and M. None for myself, J, S, or L. I don\u2019t really care that I\u2019m not getting fancy meals prepped for me, it\u2019s that they then stuff the entire fridge full of containers labeled with G, N, and M. No one else has room to use the fridge at all (see photo above; everything in there except the top shelf and 2 produce drawers is meal prepped for G, N, and M). I admit our fridge is small, but it isn\u2019t hard to be considerate of your friends/roommates in shared spaces. Especially because N does not live here.\nNow, N has been going through some things in life that would make it hard for anyone; loss of a loved one back in Spring, parent remarrying, tension with family/roommates, however I can\u2019t just continue to excuse whatever this is as someone grieving or going through it. I feel like I\u2019m being duped, we have six tenants on the lease but seven people live here. It wouldn\u2019t even be very difficult to add another person to the lease as our landlord has told us multiple times our home is zoned for up to eight people. It would also lower everyone\u2019s rent cost. I am really reaching a boiling point as we had a roommate discussion when we moved in that directly addressed a lot of this. With G, we decided N would not stay more than 3-5 nights a week, would not use our utilities more than the occasional shower or to cook dinner for everyone, and would not have access to the home without G or another roommate present. Now, all of those things seem to have just been forgotten completely. We have offered to have N move in before, but G and N say they are \u201cnot ready to live together.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to be petty but clearly they already do. G also lived in N\u2019s spare bedroom at their house before we all moved in together. They have been living together since they started dating. I think it\u2019s a bullshit excuse to not pay rent.\nAm I overreacting or is this an insane overstepping of multiple established boundaries? Sorry for formatting, am on mobile.",

        "Background": "Friday night was our fifth time hanging out. He came over and we talked for a few hours. We had an unsuccessful attempt at sex, he couldn\u2019t stay hard. He explained it was turn off when I pulled out a vibrator during sex. Okay, fair. Then he kept saying he wanted pizza and I told him I don\u2019t want pizza but I want to spend more time with him so let\u2019s go. We tore up the small pizza in my kitchen. \n\nThen suddenly he\u2019s choking me. \n\nI wake up on the couch and I\u2019m like \u201cwait did I just pass out\u201d and he casually explains that he choked me, I passed out, and he had to catch me. He said he did it twice. I went on to tell him he can\u2019t do that anymore and he was telling me that no he\u2019s gonna do it again. I don\u2019t remember much after that but he must of left shortly after because I passed out on the couch. \n\nI remember what happened the next day but I didn\u2019t really think about it. I even sent him dirty videos and was texting him all throughout the morning. In the afternoon, I was babysitting my 3 toddler nieces. I didn\u2019t have much time to think and was chasing them around all day. Eventually, a thought in my head creeps up: men who choke woman are statistically more likely to kill them in the future. This thought remained in the back of my mind all day, but he wasn\u2019t violent with me. I didn\u2019t think what he did was violent. We weren\u2019t in a domestic situation. When I finally had a moment, I brought up what happened the night before to him. [Here are the texts](https://imgur.com/a/Fk41OPh) \n\n\nAnyways, the day goes on and I cook, feed, bathe my baby nieces and finally get them in bed. I spent the rest of the night cleaning up my place and then finally lay down on my couch to sleep because the girls have my bed. I can\u2019t sleep. Every time I\u2019m about to fall asleep it feels like I\u2019m not going to take my next breath like I\u2019m going to forget to breathe. I can\u2019t shake this feeling. Then I\u2019m recalling the moment he was choking me. \n\nI\u2019m looking up at my LED lights, i feel immense pressure in my head, the world is closing in on me and my vision is decreasing. Everything goes black. \n\nI\u2019m laying on the couch and I\u2019m realizing how scary it all was. My thoughts are racing and I can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m up until 5 in the morning and by then im sobbing uncontrollably. I just need to talk to someone. I text three people: him, my mom, and my best friend. My mom answers immediately and calls me. She\u2019s freaking out because I\u2019m inconsolable and she thinks something happened with the babies. Finally, I calm down enough and I barely get the words out. She\u2019s asking where he lives, saying this is not okay, telling me I need to file a police report, I need to go to the hospital, etc. I tell her I\u2019m definitely not going to the police. We talk things out, she calms me down, I wish I could hug her. \n\nHe calls me as soon as he got my text and I tell him I need to talk about what happened and he asks what I mean then I say about him choking me. He says \u201coh can I call you later\u201d and I\u2019m like yeah. He\u2019s a nurse and he works weird hours so I already felt bad about texting him about it on one of his work days. [Maybe an hour after he texts me.](https://imgur.com/a/qVKKh3Y) \n\nThen he calls me. He tells me that it\u2019s a fetish and he\u2019s done it before. An ex girlfriend was into it and he was scared to try it at first but then he ended up liking it. He\u2019s had people ask him to do it to them. Erotic asphyxiation. I\u2019m really trying to figure out why he did it in the first place. I remember what happened, but I am prone to blacking out. Did I miss something or am I forgetting something? Maybe he got consent and we talked about it. From my point of view of the events, he choked me randomly. And this was really concerning to me. I\u2019m trying to get him to tell me what happened from his perspective and he says he doesn\u2019t remember. He says, and this is almost verbatim: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to insinuate, but you black out a lot. Maybe you\u2019re making stuff up\u201d I was stunned. At this point he\u2019s being really condescending and now im back tracking trying to reassure him I\u2019m not mad or anything I\u2019m just trying to get the bottom of things. \n\nAfter the phone call I feel really shitty. I go on about the day trying to hold it together for the girls. We go to the park, play until it rains then go to McDonald\u2019s for food and I head to my best friends house so we can eat and hang out. I tell her what happened and we talk it and she reassures. Then I drop the girls off at their home. I\u2019m on the way to my house and I just start sobbing and I can\u2019t stop. I call him and he answers. I tell him I know you don\u2019t want to dwell on this but I can\u2019t get it off my mind. I ask if he could just acknowledge and apologize for what happened and he says I\u2019m sorry you feel that way. He says I didn\u2019t leave any marks on you, you\u2019re fine. And I\u2019m like \u201cwhat you did was fucked up please just say sorry\u201d. He says, VERBATIM: \u201cI\u2019m a good trustworthy person. People trust me with their kids, their house, their money. You\u2019re trying to make me out to be some monster\u201d then he says this whole thing is really sad and he\u2019s going to take himself out of this conversation. We hang up and I go to block him on everything and I find that\u2019s he\u2019s blocked me first. Whatever. \n\nLater that night I go to the hospital with my mom. I want to make sure I don\u2019t have any unseen damage. My mom urges me to file a police report. Both her and the PA say the same thing: this probably isn\u2019t the first or the last time he\u2019s going to do this to someone. I can\u2019t bring myself to take any action against him. I was involved in a dv situation with my ex years prior. Nothing happened then and I don\u2019t believe anything will happen now. \n\n[I text him while I was at the hospital.](https://imgur.com/a/GGbzb67) \n\nI blacked out two of the times we hung out. We had sex those times, and the days after he told me I pushed him off me but then wanted him to come back. He never mentioned me choking him, so I do think he\u2019s 100% lying about this. He mentions a situation with my friend - I slept with her man/situationship/boyfriend/whatever a year ago and she recently found out about it. \n\nHe throws all these things back in my face. I feel very shitty like it was my fault like I deserved it. I\u2019m so conflicted because despite it all I miss him. I just wish this never happened and I wish I handled it better. \n\n  \n\nEDIT: Yes, he\u2019s been blocked!! Since the last message I attached. He presented as normal, well, until he wasn\u2019t that night\u2026 \nAnd, no!!  There were no kids around!! I was babysitting the day after it happened. \n\nTLDR; an intimate partner randomly chokes me after eating pizza then attempts to gaslight and manipulate me about the situation. \n\n\nUPDATE: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/SJEIAL1bJV\n",

        "Background": "(I already posted this here but I found out how to add the screenshots)\nSo I (19) and my boyfriend (21) went to my cousin's wedding (28). At the rehearsal while we were practicing for the wedding, all of the groomsmen (I don't know any of them, I barely know the person she married. I don't live with my parents anymore she's only been with him for a year.) we're making sexual comments towards me and my sister (25). We were all supposed to be parked up with our partners my sister is married. The pastor didn't want that (apparently the one who grabbed me is the one who asked the pastor too) so my sister went down with my boyfriend twice and her husband once while we were rehearsing for the wedding. I had to walk down with a stand in for one of the groomsmen (he didn't do anything wrong he just walked down the aisle normally with me). But the second time I walked down I had to go with one of the groomsmen. (I later found out from my boyfriend and my brother in law that while they were getting in line the groomsmen kept talking about me and my sister. When my boyfriend told them who he was they told him he couldn't handle me and there was no way I was with him the one who said it to him is the one who grabbed me.) While I walked down with him he kept yanking me to him so my hips and everything were rubbing against him. (I think to make my leg touch his I was wearing shorts.)  When we got to the end of the aisle he wouldn't let go of me and kept pulling me back towards him, when I was trying to get my arm out of his hold he left a handprint on my. I told this to a family friend that was there and they said they'd tell my cousin (who was like a sister to me.) The next day they still made sexual comments but a lot of other stuff happened but the usher grabbed my arm while I was trying to walk down the aisle (on the wedding day). I did it just how we practiced but he yanked me back and held me hard. (he also left a handprint) I stared at him and I guess I missed my cue or whatever so he shoved me forward. I didn't go to the reception and after I told everyone what happened (even tho I ran around all day at the wedding trying to tell people and they told me not to ruin my cousin's day). My point is though no one cared (my mother told me it happened because of the way I was dressed, my cousin told my boyfriend we were acting like children and just needed to get over it and I was taking things to the extreme. I also was wearing a tank top and shorts I had a hoodie wrapped around my waist at the rehearsal my sister had a hoodie and sweatpants on i was not dressed inappropriately it was hot when we left my house. It was August 2.) I've blocked my whole family other than my sister and brother in law.

        "Topic": "",
        "Background": "Let me preface this with the fact that I am a huge animal lover. Ever since a young age, I have been obsessed with animals, volunteering in rescues and shelters, picking up strays, rehabbing wildlife, even rescuing bugs at work (I have a designated bug cup and everyone knows to come get me instead of killing them). Everyone in my life that knows me knows I love animals. I love them even more than most people. \n\nI saved our dog, Lola, from a puppy mill situation when she was 14 weeks old. She had a grade 6 heart murmur and was given less than 6 months to live. I brought her home without parental permission hoping at the very least to give her a peaceful place to pass away. My parents weren't thrilled, but agreed to let her stay. Luckily, my mom ended up falling in love with her and so my parents paid for life-saving surgery. \n\nFast forward 15 years and Lola's health started to fail. We could tell that she was having a hard time seeing and hearing, but she was still ambulating and eating on her own. About a month ago, she became incontinent. This did not sit well with my parents. They are very particular about their home and do not like even minor inconveniences (like putting a dog on a leash is too much for them). Accidents in the house were considered a major inconvenience, so almost immediately, they were talking about euthanasia. I voiced my opinion stating that it was cruel to put a dog down simply for being old or mildly inconvenient. That the incontinence could have a medical reason that might be easily treatable, like a UTI, and it would be unfair to consider euthanasia without having her checked out first. They didn't really appreciate this opinion and were very dismissive verbally, BUT my mom did take her to the vet anyway. \n\nAt that appointment, it was determined that she did have a UTI. However, they also discovered that she was severely anemic, had fluid in her abdomen, and was in kidney failure. The vet at that appointment talked my mom out of euthanasia. The vet made it very clear that the symptoms could be managed with medication and Lola could have another 6 months or so at her current quality of life. They treated the UTI with antibiotics, gave her IV fluids, an injection for the anemia, and some meds for nausea and diarrhea. They also told us that she would need to be on a bland, home made diet of chicken/turkey, rice, eggs, and cottage cheese. \n\nMy parents acted like these very simple adjustments (diapers, a daily pill, and food prepping once a week) were extreme measures to take to keep her alive. My mom made the first batch of food with canned chicken and microwave rice and seasoned it with garlic, salt, and pepper. When I noticed what she was doing, I explained that garlic was toxic to dogs and that added salt was bad for anyone in kidney failure. My mother was, again, very dismissive, so I started making Lola's food myself. I got fresh ground turkey and chicken, salmon, frozen and fresh veggies, brown rice, and even some baby foods. I tried to give her as much variety as possible, but still bland. This went on for 3 weeks. \n\nOn 1/26, I made another batch of food for the week - ground turkey, peas, brown rice, eggs, and a little olive oil. No seasoning. My parents got home from a trip on 1/27 and my mom resumed their regular routine which included feedings. My work schedule is essentially 12/1pm to 8/9pm, but I sometimes end up staying until 10pm or later. Since the dogs are used to eating earlier, my mom usually feeds them unless her and my dad are out of town. Because of scheduling conflicts the week prior, I was staying late this particular week to catch up on work and make up hours. Also, of note - Lola would sleep with my parents and Fitz would sleep with me, so I hadn't seen Lola since the morning of 1/29 because I wasn't getting home from work until well after my parents were in bed.\n\nOn 1/31 around 12:20pm (right before I was leaving for work), my mom tells me that she had to put Lola down that morning. She says it all happened very suddenly which is why she wasn't able to tell me ahead of time. She said that she woke up around 2:30am and Lola was having trouble breathing, so she took her to our regular vet when they opened and it was the vet's recommendation to euthanize her. She hugged me and cried and I was still in  a state of shock because the last time I saw Lola she was perfectly fine. I would even say peppy. After she left, I sobbed for about 20 minutes and then went to work. On my way to work, I see that she sent a text to our family group chat, which basically reiterated the story she told me. \n\nOnce I got to work, I was just angry. I had been home from 11:30pm the night before until 20 minutes ago. My parents had every opportunity to walk or yell down the stairs to tell me something was wrong with Lola. They had every opportunity to tell me they were taking her to the vet. I could have been there. I could have said goodbye. I didn't understand it. That feeling festered all day. That night, I got home early because we were celebrating my mom's and sister's birthdays. My eyes were puffy from crying all day and I could barely look at my parents I was so upset. They were acting like everything was normal, like nothing had happened that morning. All of Lola's stuff was already gone - bowls, leashes, crate, etc. Like they couldn't get rid of it fast enough. Of her, fast enough. We made it through dinner and cake and I went to bed. \n\nThe next morning I woke up earlier than usual and went upstairs to feed Fitz and let him outside. He gets a mix of HSD wet food with his dry food, so I opened the fridge to grab it and noticed the food I had made for Lola was still in there. Not wanting it to go to waste, I grabbed it to give to Fitz. However, as soon as I opened it, I was overwhelmed by the smell of garlic. So much so, that my eyes were watering. The food was literally SMOTHERED in garlic powder. Now, I was suspicious. Why would my mother saturate Lola's food with garlic powder after I had told her that garlic was toxic to dogs? I put the container back in the fridge planning to confront her about it when she got home, but when I went to make lunch later that day, the food was gone.\n\nI questioned myself, truthfully. Do I think my mother is capable of doing something like this? To a dog she supposedly loves? Is it even possible to kill a dog with garlic? So, I went online to do some research and it turns out - yes, it is possible. Garlic can kill a small dog fairly easily. It's weight-based and Lola was only 9lbs. A concentrated amount (like that found in garlic powder) over the course of 3 or 4 days can lead to severe anemia and multi-organ failure, one of the symptoms being trouble breathing... \n\nI sobbed for days and kept going back and forth about what to do. I spoke to friends and co-workers about it to get their opinions. I thought about calling the vet and asking for an autopsy. I finally worked up the courage to call on Tuesday. What do you even say? \"Hi. I think my mom poisoned our dog with garlic.\" Yikes. Anyway, it turns out the vet that examined Lola and performed the euthanasia was out on vacation and wouldn't be back until 2/18, so I couldn't talk to him. However, the receptionist was able to tell me that she was actually the one that spoke to my mother when she called to make the appointment. She said that it was made in advance and that my mother specifically requested euthanasia as the reason for the visit. She was also able to tell me that my mother had not refilled any of Lola's medications. So the entire story my mom told me and the text she sent to our family group chat was a complete fabrication.  Not only did she have time to tell me before taking Lola in, but she may have planned it and intentionally poisoned her to speed up the process. \n\nFast forward to 2/9. My parents and I haven't spoken. I'm remaining cordial, but I've essentially stopped engaging with them outside of unavoidable interaction. My mom decides to make dinner, so I attend. I literally don't know if I could speak to them without getting emotional, so I remain silent. Out of nowhere, my dad asks if I ever responded to my sister about whether my birthday dinner was still happening on 2/15. I said, \"No. Not yet.\" He smirks and says \"Oh, you didn't?\", so I said, \"I responded to her asking why she was asking about it, but that was it. Why?\" And he laughed and said, \"Well, I think we're all wondering if you're still going to be giving us the silent treatment by then.\" So I said, \"I'm not sure how I'm supposed to answer that. I'm not giving you the silent treatment. I'm literally talking to you right now.\" To which he replies, \"Well, maybe not me, but you're giving it to your mother and that's unfair.\" And that really just set me off, to be honest, \"Unfair? You know what I think is unfair? Lying to me about how Lola died and not giving me an opportunity to say goodbye. That's unfair!\" Then my mom chimes in with \"What do you think I lied about?\" And, at this point, I'm cry-yelling as I tell her about my call to our vet and that I know it was scheduled for 9:30am and that I think she is responsible. My mom doesn't respond at all and my dad only says, \"Well, what difference would that have made?\"  To which I replied, \"A huge difference! I could have said goodbye! You stole any final moments I could have had with her and then lied to me about it.\" And then I got up and went downstairs. None of us have spoken since. Things are very tense in the house. I'm worried about my other dog now. \n\nMy sister and I got into it, too. She thinks I'm overreacting because I \"will always care more about animals than other people do.\" I understand that other people may not feel the same way I feel about animals, but I would think people that care about me would respect and consider my feelings. I feel like I'm being gaslit into thinking I am in the wrong and that I need to apologize to my mother. I truly don't feel that way. I feel betrayed and distrustful and just utterly devastated about Lola's passing. Any advice would be helpful. I am really struggling here. ",

        "Background": "I (26F) have been best friends with Max (32F) for 12 years. We met online through writing forums, and have spent over the last decade writing together. We had dreams of publishing together, and had extensive, Game Of Thrones level world building, plots and characters. I considered her a sister, and given I barely talk to my birth family, she was the most important person in my life until I met my wife 4 years ago. I even moved cross country from the Midwest to the east cost when I was 19 to live with Max, although I had to move back to the Midwest three years ago because of finances.\n\nI was the maid of honor for her wedding. I feel like I put my heart and soul into our friendship, and I self admittedly had pretty bad codependency issues with her for a good deal of our friendship. However, for at least the entire second half of our friendship, it's felt very unbalanced to me, sometimes because I definitely put too much into relationships,maybe to a degree that was unfair to except in return. When my friends have problems, I will drop everything to help them, I want them to be successful and happy. I felt I did not get that in return.\n\nMore recent info: Max had twin boys two and half years ago, just a couple months after I had to move back home. I was gutted I wasn't able to be there, we had talked extensively about how I would be involved in their lives. I am their godmother. We'd discussed me helping them by providing free/cheap childcare. I was very close to flying right over, ignoring all job responsibilities, to be with her when she gave birth and her boys had to be in the NICU just from being preemie twin boys. The only real reason I didn't was because my wife was already out of town for a funeral and one of our dogs has aggression issues that makes boarding or finding last minute dog sitters impossible. However, I did fly over for almost a full month almost two months after they were born to help care for them- I did overnights, fed them, changed diapers, babysat, anything I could to help.\n\nSince then, I've visited. Note: in our entire friendship, Max has never visited me. I visited her twice, as a teenager, before I moved closer to her, and a couple times after moving.\n\nCrux of the issue: I gave birth earlier this month. My baby was incredibly premature, at only 22 weeks gestation. I texted Max as I was in the hospital what was going on, that I was being discharged and that my baby had been transferred to a level 4 NICU. I followed my baby to the secondary hospital only a few hours after birth, and operated on basically no sleep while my baby fought for her life. I noticed after 24 hours of a lot of hecticness that Max had never responded, and did not check up on me. Meanwhile, my wife had her sister's checking up on her, and my local friend had come to the hospital to visit. I was pissed. I was so upset- probably because I hadn't slept, but also because I had, over the many years, always felt like Max did not show up for me when I had trouble, be cause she always seemed to have harder problems and I always had to put aside my feelings to make her feel better. but surely, my baby fighting for her little life and myself having gone through a very traumatic birth was finally enough to warrant her attention, right? Then 44 hours after my baby was born, she passed. I posted on Facebook to announce later that day. Max left a heart, sent me an extremely basic condolence message. I admit I did not respond, but I feel I have a good excuse of having been busy.\n\nI did not hear back from Max again for two weeks. No check up. Nothing. After just a couple days I was already pissed, and I was sort of just waiting to see how long it would take her. Then, two days ago, she sent me a message claiming to be supportive, that she was there for me. Again, I'm pissed because I know how useless her support is now.\n\nI've included the screenshots of our entire text conversation from the moment she found out my baby died to my message. I will stop rambling now, and wait for any advice. I'm so lost. I'm already grieving my daughter, and I am devastated I might be losing my best friend as well over this. I can't handle so much loss at once. Please tell me if I'm wildly overreacting because of this situation and need to tone it down, and what I need to say if so, or if I'm right in my instincts that this is no longer a friendship worth saving.",

I accepted in the past the many times I had something going on in my life, and you were to busy with your own life constantly falling apart to support me. I convinced myself that, when I really needed it, you would step up and be my best friend and support me. Then I went into labor, my baby went into the NICU, and my best friend, who I used to consider a sister, left me on read for two of the worst days of my life. Then I got basic, Hallmark card worthy condolences, and then radio silence for two weeks. I'm sure you have a lot you're dealing with. You always do. Right now I cannot bring myself to care.

I broke up with him because over the course of our relationship he became more and more moody, mean, passive aggressive, etc. no matter how hard I tried to establish healthy patterns with him. In short, he was a dick to me and gaslit me any time I tried to call him out on it.\n\nWe hung out last night (which was off a whim and not common, we have only talked/seen each other in passing since the breakup) and went out for drinks. We met a couple we ended up making friends with, so we stayed out later and drank more than I originally intended. \n\nAt some point in the night I realized he was starting to beef with a guy at the bar. I went over to them and realized my ex was antagonizing this guy and the guy was starting to get super irritated. I intervened and managed to resolve the conflict, and my ex invited him back to our building for a drink in apology for causing an issue. \n\nWe ended up going to my apartment because it\u2019s bigger than his. My ex was more drunk than both me and the other guy. My ex started hitting on the guy and it became blatantly clear that my ex was trying to make a move on this guy right in front of my face. I was in shock as I started to connect all the dots about how mean and frustrated he was with this new realization that he was closeted gay or bi (he VEHEMENTLY opposed the notion he had even a remotely sexual interest in men as if it were appalling). \n\nWanting to be respectful despite my feelings and minding the fact that the other guy might be into it, I said \u201cHey guys, I\u2019m obviously third wheeling here, if you want to hang out just you two can you go to [my ex\u2019s] apartment so I can go to bed?\u201d The other guy made it very clear he didn\u2019t want to hang out just them two. So I dropped it and kept hanging out. \n\nAs my ex continued to hit on him, the guy got more and more obviously uncomfortable. Then my ex said \u201cCome to the bathroom and pee with me.\u201d The guy was like, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d And my ex was taunting him, \u201cCome on, I know you have to pee, just come in the bathroom to pee with me.\u201d I started getting nervous that this guy was going to try to fight my ex cause that made him super agitated and he was like \u201cNo wtf bro\u201d and my ex wouldn\u2019t drop it. I said, \u201cHe said no. You\u2019re making everyone uncomfortable by refusing to let it go.\u201d \n\nLong story short, this went on until I started asking him to please leave. He wouldn\u2019t leave and called me \u201cretarded\u201d multiple times while trying to physically, facially, and verbally intimidate me. It escalated to the point I stood at the door holding it open with my voice raised, \u201cPlease leave. I\u2019m asking you to please leave my house,\u201d until he finally left, immediately after which he sent me the texts calling me a \u201cNeanderthal\u201d and \u201cpsychopath\u201d and saying \u201cyou deserve nothing.\u201d\n\nI sent him the message calling out what happened and saying not to talk to me again or I\u2019d call the police. He showed up at my door, knocking. I didn\u2019t answer. He called me more than 20 times. All while texting me this stuff, switching between being rude and apologetic. He was also mixing in some gaslighting by pretending the night didn\u2019t happen (\u201csorry for being possessive over you\u201d\u2026 like\u2026 what??). It\u2019s possible he doesn\u2019t remember and doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, but I\u2019ve never known him to blackout often, and if he did, I HIGHLY doubt he had no memory of anything because this was going on for hours til I finally got him to leave.\n\nAIO for sending him this message and refusing to answer his calls or talk to him? Right now I want to leave it at this and never speak to him again.",

No texts no indirects nothing...Just silence...\nThen suddenly..\nHe sent a message & deleted it before I could read it then after that..he liked my Insta story (which was just me looking happy) & yesterday he changed his DP to an old photo..the one he knew was my favorite...\nAnd then a mutual friend sent me a screenshot of a whatsapp status he posted that said --\n\n> \"Girls who don\u2019t want to live with their in laws should find a groom in an orphanage not in a family.\"\n\n\nNow mutual friends are saying he has a point that if I wanted to be a \u201cpriority\"  I should\u2019ve just \u201cmarried an orphan\u201d & honestly? Now I\u2019m confused...\n\nFor the record I NEVER said I wouldn\u2019t live with in laws... I never told him to abandon his mom... I just asked a simple question about priorities somehow this turned into the biggest fight of our relationship...\n\n**The actual words I said were:\n\"A man is supposed to love & respect his mother right? That\u2019s okay just like a woman loves & respects her parents... But once they get married their spouse becomes their main responsibility & priority right? A mother will always hold an important place but just like a daughter becomes her husband's responsibility isn\u2019t it the same for a son? So tell me in an important situation who comes first\u2014your mother, your wife, or your daughter?\"***\n\nThat\u2019s it... That was my crime! & now I feel like everyone\u2019s making me out to be the bad guy for even asking... Like I was being unreasonable like I disrespected his mom or something...\n\nI won\u2019t lie this whole thing has been hard... I miss him & part of me wonders if I should\u2019ve handled things differently...Maybe I should\u2019ve just let it go? Maybe I overreacted? IDK I feel so anxious about it all...\nSo was I actually wrong? Was I expecting too much by wanting to be a priority in my own marriage? Should I have just handled this differently? Should I apologize?\nI feel like I\u2019m losing my mind here... What do yall think?",

        "Background": "To elaborate a bit further, I am a 30yr old (M) and I\u2019ve been transitioned since August of 2017. Out, name changed and on T. \n\nAbout two months ago, right around Trumps inauguration, my wife and I reached out to my mom with some worries of executive orders that he was rapidly signing as he had promised. We brought a few things to her- our worries of the anti-LGBTQ+ orders that were being signed, things regarding the environment because we\u2019re avid nature lovers and hike often and our worries of immigration and deportation orders being signed. She is a huge Trump supporter and believes that he will in fact make America great again. So hopefully you can see why we would reach out and try to help broaden her viewpoints. She also keeps Fox News on regularly.\n\nShe shared her slightly harsh responses and wasn\u2019t really receiving the information that we were trying to present to her.\n\nShe went on to respond back then by manipulating me into consoling her because she flew into this mode of being like, \u201comg please forgive me, I way overstepped sharing my opinion and I\u2019ll never do it again. I\u2019ll keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to lose my son. I love you more than anything\u201d and turning to my wife to try and act like she was being hostile and vicious towards her by trying to share that, as my mother, she was really hurting me. I honestly felt so loved and supported by my wife and extremely confused that my own mom would turn on my wife and call her condescending and try to insinuate that she was being callous. \n\nFast forward to yesterday- I wanted to reach out one last time to try and resolve some of the unresolved feelings and real life issues we\u2019ve been facing since the beginning of this year. I was met with the above response from my mom. I feel she finally dropped a mask or peeled back another layer she was trying to keep concealed from my wife and I. We\u2019ve both been feeling lost, along with a plethora of other emotions since trying to digest this message.\n\nAIO? ",
        "Transcription": "{\"messages\": [{\"speaker\": \"Speaker A\", \"text\": \"Thank you for your explanation. You probably won't like my responses, but here goes. Yes, I know about the return of transgendered being banned from the military. Unfortunately I agree with Under order. The military is no place for equality. It's no place for individuality. It's no place for fairness. It's a place for rank and file, taking orders, and doing what needs to be done without regard to personal feelings. Military life is a hard one, for hard people who can endure under that strain. Transgender people never should have been allowed into the military. No should have gay people. I'm sorry, but that's how I feel in regard to the military. Next, the executive order restricting access to gender-affirming care for young people - under 19 years old. I agree with it wholeheartedly. No child should have their sex changed. Period. That is an extremely adult decision, and I had my sex-change affirming care would only be available for those over the age of 25 who undergone a minimum of 2 years of psychiatric care in order to ensure proper brain development and a full grasp of what undergoing a sex change means for your life. I think parents who allow their children to be mutilated should spend the rest of their lives behind bars, and that's still not as bad as what they've done to their children. By the way, there should be no such thing as a 'transgender identity.' If you are transgender, it means you live your life as the opposite you were born in. Because if you were born female, then live as male. If born male, then live as female. It is still only two genders, male and female. I agree with that order too, on principle. But I don't know what to tell the rest of the rainbow that feels they're somewhere in between the two or not at all, except dig deep and find who you truly are, because it's either male or female. Nobody cares or f***s to know who or what you're having sex with; that's not the question. The question is simply male or female. Also, the reason that gender politics is now a thing is because the LGBTQ+ community oversaturated act when they were trying to get their rights and went overboard to becoming a whole different class entirely. Nobody cared who was sleeping with who or what until it was placed front and center in all of our lives and for the last four years literally showed down our throats because they didn't know when to stop. The answer was 'when you got your rights' around the early to mid 2000's. Not 'when a drag queen is how you do story time for little kids.' I know that sounds bad, but it's true. Eventually there had to be pushback. The Q+ in the equation did it because it was just too much to handle from 2% of the population. The movement should have backed off once they achieved their goal for the LGBT community.\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Speaker B\", \"text\": \"I will agree with you about same sex marriage being overturned... I guess we can never say never on that one... but I really do feel like that couldn't get the traction it would need to be passed in this day and age. Because again, nobody cares who you're sleeping with. I also agree that the erosion of rights starts with smaller less visible actions. But you also need to ask yourself when does DEI go too far? When people are being hired to perform roles they are not qualified for, only because they are not different and there's a quota for that now. That's the same thing as affirmative action was. Hire blacks because they're black, don't worry if they have any credentials. It's racism plain and simple. So, when does DEI cross that barrier? Better, what place does DEI hold in government? We should have our best and brightest in the government of our nation. The most qualified. DEI is a problem because there's no qualification, it only goes skin deep. Racism and quotas have no place in our government or in our military. I have no problem with basing hiring in anything really, on competence. You're there to get a job done. People have forgotten that. I'm really sorry for offending you, because I'm sure this text has done it, and I am really sorry if it changes your view of me. But this is where I'm coming from. You shouldn't get handouts and hands up if you aren't individually qualified, competent, and capable of doing the job. It doesn't mean that I don't have empathy. It means life is unfair, and that's something we all have to live with. I still love you, I hope you still love me.\"}]}"

I have suspected her of opening my mail before, but she refused to admit it, and aside from it being taped shut, I really had no proof.

I wouldn\u2019t get the hair if that was the point. I am Bengali and that I always will be. But I came from a good place. As for people saying I will damage my hair even further, the truth is I will go bald again soon as I\u2019m preparing for a bone marrow transplant. Prior to which they will give me high doses of chemo which will make my hair fall out again anyways. So I wanted to enjoy the hair that had grown in the last few months while I still had it. And yes, I did consult with my dr about this before. She said it was okay. My friend will not be coming to my birthday after someone messaged her about the Reddit post, but her decision. She was also going to be my bridesmaid at my wedding but I guess that won\u2019t happen either. I also admit that I did say some things that were insensitive for which I did apologise to my friend. \n\nI\u2019ve added pics of the braids and the the picture I posted on instagram. Anyways, thank you all for your replies. Peace out \u2764\ufe0f",

I have a friend (yellow) who was looking for another club since her old one was ending due to the place closing. I asked my group if she could join and got a collective \u201cyes.\u201d She knows 2 of the other girls in the group. She\u2019s not just a straight up stranger. She is active in our group chat and read the book. We had our first club since adding her yesterday. One of the girls (green) always host book club - no idea why, she just insists (this is important.) so apparently everyone except me and another girl thought that yellow \u201cwas too much\u201d and \u201ctoo much energy\u201d. Mind you we\u2019re are a crazy loud group of girls and she was no more than any of us. I do think she was trying a little hard to fit in but this was her first time meeting most of the girls. Later I find out that green (the host) is threatening to not host anymore if yellow stays in the club. They had one interaction with her and barely even talked to her.

That was not even the issue today! Like no politics is trump behavior because it is inappropriate. It is just something YOU don't want to hear and your taking away free speech. I gotta stop but i think you made a big mistake there. And i think they already agree with me because again they messaged me privately and were concerned. Censoring political content is such a fuck you to humanity right now. like people who love people do not censor each other on things that are perfectly appropriate. I want to end by saying i am sorry for the spam, but please take that rule off. People are not going to talk about politics most likely and you can manage that on a case by case basis. I know that what is coming across is not your intention and i know you do not support whats happening in our country just as much as me. But this is making it look like you do because it is what is happening to us on every social media platform right now. I know you may not realize that, and even though im clearly upset about this and so are your followers i still care about you and trust you to do the right thing. Even though im at work, feel free to call me when you get up to talk about this. I really don't want this to be a big deal and i know this has clearly sparked a lot of emotions within me but i want to help. Here are a set of rules that i think still get the point across without actively applying censorship to your viewers. again i think the no politics is actually a very political rule. I am re reading everything i said now and i want to apologize for getting so upset. I know that you did not mean to make people censored, but you want to keep your page positive and negativity always come with political talk. I understand and i agree that you don't need nor have to have any political talk in your discord. I respect and agree that there is no need for political talk in your discord channel. I just think the rule should be phrased around being supporting and loving to everyone rather than the negative vibe of no politics. I care about you so so much and i know that you want the best for all humans. This is such a shitty time that we are all being forced to navigate and i want you to remember that i am on your team and i want you to do what's best for you. So everything i am saying, even if i could have phrased it better, was because i care about you and want to have an amazing twitch and discord that radiates the positivity and love that i know you want to spread within the community you create. and again i am sorry, im only passionate about this because i feel so strongly for all of the people whose lives are being destroyed by our government is not the real issue i was projecting and i shouldn't have\"}]}"

He was super abusive. Had a huge cocaine addiction, drugged my joint with acid without telling me, cheated on me multiple times, threatened to kill his mom while blacked out on bars & got sent to the psych ward bc of it, threw a three wick candle at my head, etc etc. But I was young & this was my first relationship, so I thought it was chill. (i know, v naive of me) \n\nPretty close to the end of our relationship, we \u201cgot a dog together\u201d (which like, not really bc I was a child and we didn\u2019t live together. I bought a dog and kept it at his parents house lol) We made an instagram account for the dog & then like 2 months later I realized how horrible he was and broke up with him. I never saw him or the dog again. \n\nI thought I had blocked him from everything & moved across the country 2 years after breaking up and haven\u2019t thought about him in 10 years, besides processing the trauma I went through. \n\nThis last week, I was back in my home state looking for apartments because I\u2019ll be moving back at the end of the year. I guess somehow news got to Brad that I was in town, and he reached out to me using the 10 Y/O DOGS INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT (that I didn\u2019t even know still existed or followed me.) with a sob story about how the dog is old and because he\u2019s dying he wanted to give me a chance to say goodbye. I blocked him after telling him not to contact me again. \n\nI thought it was weird as hell, and a manipulative tactic to get me to see him. It also made me feel weird knowing he had access to my account this whole time, and he was watching my stories that I had posted the day he dmed me. It made me super uncomfortable, but now I\u2019m overthinking and wondering if I was over reacting & if he was being genuine and trying to like, apologize without apologizing. I know I\u2019ve grown a LOT in these last 10 years (duh- literally was a child who has grown into a young adult) so a part of me wants to assume that he has, too. \nBut like, this felt weird. \n\nAm I over reacting to this?

        "Background": "I was shook when I received this insane demand and manipulative af message from my ex\u2019s mom yesterday.  \n\nBackground on this-before I met my now ex bf his family had been planning a big family trip to Ireland which was to take place in Spring 2025.  This was always presented as a gift from the parents to their kids and their significant others.  I was invited on the trip and told my airfare and accommodations were to be paid by my ex\u2019s parents who I was quite close with prior to our breakup.  \n\nA plane ticket was purchased by the parents for me and my ex to meet his family in Ireland.  The trip was planned for this past April.  The tickets were purchased by the parents in the Fall.  My ex and I split officially in February and it was not at all amicable.  I cut off contact with him and his family at that point.  So they had a few months prior to their trip to Ireland to figure out what to do with the ticket.  \n\nAbout a week ago I heard from my ex asking if I wanted to buy the airline credit from him since it\u2019s in my name.  He said he\u2019d take less than the value of the ticket.  I told him I didn\u2019t have travel plans or money and he should contact the airline to see about a transfer or something.  He told me he contacted them and nothing can be done since it\u2019s in my name.  Whatever, not my problem.  \n\nWell, yesterday his Mom reaches out with the text in the pic above.  Her attempt at reframing a gift as some sort of debt I owe her is insane and manipulative.  This is absolutely not my problem to solve.  And if the ticket was in my name for months prior to actually going on their family vacation-I feel they could have or should have done something at that point.  Cancellation insurance?  I don\u2019t know, bc I didn\u2019t buy the ticket or make any of the arrangements for this.  I was an invited guest.  And if everything hadn\u2019t been covered as I was initially offered by my ex and his family-I wouldn\u2019t have gone bc I could not afford it after being laid off in the Spring. \n\nSo tell me, am I overreacting at this absurd and completely inappropriate contact from my ex\u2019s Mom?  She has no business to be speaking with me and pretending to be \u201cpatient\u201d in getting the money I absolutely do not owe her back. \n\nNot to mention-the main issue for the breakup was my ex\u2019s affinity for lies and manipulation.  I discovered he was facing two lawsuits over unpaid cc debt, and was tens of thousands behind on child support with his ex wife who has been withholding custody from him.  He moved into my home and\nNot once did he contribute the agreed upon amount for the mortgage and utilities.  He always had excuses and I didn\u2019t press him bc it would lead to an explosive fight.  I was footing most of the household bills while he lived with me.  So him being desperate for money doesn\u2019t surprise me.  The demand from his Mom actually shocks me.  I blocked her and the rest of his family everywhere I could and I do not plan to respond to the text.  There\u2019s a ton I could say and want to set the record straight, but it\u2019s not worth being dragged back into toxic drama and nonsense with these people.  They can all kick rocks.  Just leave me the eff alone. \n\n\nTLDR-ex boyfriends Mom wants me to pay her back for an airline ticket she purchase for me for a trip I was invited on but never attended since my ex and I broke up before it took place.

And yeah, sorry if this post is unnecessarily long, I\u2019m a bad storyteller and sometimes put unnecessary details in my stories. :(\n\nAgain, sorry for the long post, I tried my best to break it up into paragraphs. :((\n\nFYI this is a burner account because my fianc\u00e9 and our friends all use Reddit and have my account. We all follow each other.\n\nOkay, so I (18F) am engaged to my fianc\u00e9 (26M), we\u2019ll call him Dylan. Dylan and I have been dating for 2 years and he recently proposed on my birthday in June. It was super sweet and both of our families and friends were present and it was probably the best birthday present I could\u2019ve asked for. Seriously, I still get butterflies thinking about it. Now, fast forward to September. School has recently started not too long ago for my state and my fianc\u00e9 works as a teacher at my old high school. Don\u2019t worry, he wasn\u2019t a teacher then, he was just a TA. We barely even saw each other. However, since summer break is over, this means he\u2019s gone earlier in the mornings before I wake up which doesn\u2019t bother me. School starts at 7:05 am on the dot, so he has to be there by at least 6:25 am. He typically leaves at around 6:00-ish because the school isn\u2019t too far from his house and the traffic never usually starts until like around 6:30. School started in August, so I\u2019ve started getting used to waking up and him not being there. However, I\u2019ve decided to start waking up earlier and surprising him with some form of breakfast. Nothing fancy, just a toasted bagel with egg, ham, and cheese in between and a coffee to go with it. Since Dylan pays for the bills in his own home, I figured the least I could do is make breakfast when he leaves and make some sort of dinner when he comes home if I am home. Like I said, I live with my parents, so I\u2019m not at his house all the time. However, yesterday, I woke up at around 5:00 am to make him breakfast, like I always do whenever I have the time. But, when I went downstairs, he was already sitting on the couch and pulling his shoes on which really confused me because normally he\u2019s just waking up around that time too.\n\nI asked Dylan why he was dressed so early and he looked kind of startled to see me but he told me he has to go in early to fill in for another teacher who was going to be absent that day. I was confused and asked why they couldn\u2019t just get a substitute teacher and asked who was going to fill in for his own class. He said the school would take care of it but they told him he needed to fill in for this teacher\u2019s class and that he has to leave earlier to \u201cprepare\u201d for it or something. I asked Dylan, \u201cWhat about breakfast?\u201d And he told me that he\u2019ll just stop at a gas station and grab something quick on the way. I was honestly so sleepy, I didn\u2019t even remember what else he said because he just kissed my forehead and before I opened my eyes again, he was out the door. I was so confused, I just went back to sleep. But, when I woke up again way later, I thought about it and wondered why he couldn\u2019t just leave at his usual time if he needed to be a substitute? And why the school couldn\u2019t just get a substitute to cover that class? I literally went to that school since middle school in 2018 and I know that they have a regular set of substitute teachers. It\u2019s to the point where me and my friends used to memorize which subs were strict and which ones were more chill. So, a teacher covering another teacher\u2019s class has literally never happened and if it has, it\u2019s super rare. I\u2019m upset with myself for not bringing this up earlier in the text messages, but I was pretty emotional and not thinking clearly at the time. For context, \u201cLauren\u201d (24F) is his ex-girlfriend. They dated for 7 years from 2015-2021 so they were already a thing before I even moved to our state in 2017 and Lauren is actually a family friend. Dylan said that lockdown during the pandemic made them realize they were just incompatible and they split on good terms in 2021, just two years before Dylan asked me out. Dylan, Lauren, and our two other friends Anna (25F) and Anna\u2019s husband, Josh (28M) are all in the same friend group by the way. Yes, this matters. \n\nBasically, the same day he had left super early, Lauren invited us over to her place to watch a movie in the afternoon. While we were there just talking, I had these really intense pre-period cramps and Lauren told me to go into her bedroom and into the bathroom where the medicine was so I could take some ibuprofen. While I was in the bedroom, I saw something familiar on the dresser. They were Dylan\u2019s glasses. He left the house that morning with his glasses on and I knew they were his glasses because they were just recognizable. I know I sound crazy but those glasses couldn\u2019t have been anybody else\u2019s but Dylan\u2019s. I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I grabbed them, got the ibuprofen and headed downstairs. I asked Lauren why Dylan\u2019s glasses were on her dresser and Lauren, Anna, and Josh all got super quiet. I was super thrown off by the way all three of them just stared at me.\n\nLauren just shrugged and told me to return them to Dylan if I went to his house. I looked to Anna and Josh because I was confused why they were so quiet and refusing to look at me when Lauren just casually mentioned to Anna, not me, that Dylan had to come by to pick up something and all three of them agreed which felt super weird. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t have cared if Dylan went over to Lauren\u2019s place because he\u2019s an adult and he can do whatever he wants and we\u2019re all friends with Lauren but the dresser beside Lauren\u2019s bed was a weird place to find his glasses. Also the way my friends acted when I brought it up felt weird. I ended up going home early because I didn\u2019t feel too well. I ended up calling Dylan and asking why he left his glasses there and why he lied and didn\u2019t tell me that that was where he was going. I would\u2019ve been fine if he had gone, I just don\u2019t get why he had to lie and not tell me. Dylan said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t need this from me right now\u201d and then hung up on me. I burst into tears because never has Dylan ever hung up on me. Then that whole text exchange between me and Dylan happened. I\u2019m at my parents\u2019 house right now instead of Dylan\u2019s because he is refusing to speak to me over this. He feels upset that I would accuse him of something like this and our friends are siding with him. Anna reached out to me. She called me and told me that she understands that this is my first relationship but I can\u2019t just accuse the person I\u2019m going to marry of cheating. Josh also agreed and said that I was being childish and acting immaturely. Dylan also said the same thing and Lauren is refusing to speak to me because she\u2019s super hurt that I would ever think she would do that behind my back. They all think I am being childish and overreacting over nothing, but I don\u2019t know. My other friend (18F) who is an online friend told me that it\u2019s weird and that I should check his phone but I don\u2019t want to be a jealous girlfriend.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I overreacting? Please tell me because all of my friends and my fianc\u00e9 are super upset with me and I\u2019m starting to wonder if I caused trouble. I know I shouldn\u2019t care if Dylan goes over to Lauren\u2019s house because we are all friends but I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t tell me. I feel like I\u2019m crazy because my entire friend group is saying I\u2019m making something out of nothing and that I\u2019m doing too much. I just don\u2019t know anymore and I\u2019m so tired. :(",

        "Background": "I really need you guys to look at this old message that my partner T F27 just showed me. She told me that her sister K F23 had wrote her this paragraph a long time ago , and she had it saved in her notes because she knew it was slightly confusing.\n\nA little bit of context , before I even dated T I knew that her and her sister K were a duo. They were inseparable , they look very alike, Dress similar , have similar tattoo placements etc.  They also had an apartment together. I was fortunate to meet T individually though since we met in our workplace.\n\nEven after dating me for a while it took her sister K 6 months to even want to meet me. K made it weird sometimes because if she came home from work and I was there she would WAIT in her car for me to LEAVE before she even came up, forcing my girlfriend T to just send me home because if not her sister would stay in the car . LOL\n\nThere\u2019s so many more WEIRD things that she did to us before meeting me but eventually she came around. When she came around , she had switched her energy towards me 100% and turned her charm on. She would say to me \u201c Yea me and T are the same person so if you guys are close me and you will be close too !\u201d\n\nAfter that I was welcomed into their family fully , and we had so many nice moments for a couple months . Even though within those nice moments K always showed signs of extreme jealousy I always brushed it off and she would do her part to TRY to hide it\u2026 UNTIL I got in a car accident and totaled my car. I was going through a lot of hardships and my GF T told me to stay with them in the meantime.\n\nAfter 1 month of me staying with them is when K turned her charm back OFF.  Even though i obviously did my part and gave them rent , cleaned and helped with everything else , K still couldn\u2019t hide her jealousy anymore.\n\nShe would treat T horrible , make her feel guilty for everything always saying things like \u201c yea I guess I have to go alone now \u201c or simply ignoring T and saying things like \u201c oh I just don\u2019t want to have to bother you now \u201c while T would bend over backwards trying to be there for me AND her little sister.\n\nOne day T couldn\u2019t bear the way she was being treated anymore so she send K a message trying to communicate how she feels. That day when me and T got home from work the apartment was EMPTY ! She took all her things away and moved back into her mom\u2019s house.  There\u2019s so many more details that I won\u2019t write but she made this time hell for me and my gf T .  Derated our names , exposed my gfs sexuality to the whole family . She technically got my gfs family to turn on my gf , which is crazy since T is always the one to put her family first before herself.\n\nMe and my gf are ok we moved into a house and have actually been flourishing since K left Ts life. T feels like she can finally be T individually instead of always being seen as a duo and more importantly she can finally pour into me and our relationship without having to feel so guilty.\n\nAnywho , my gf recently found this text message that K send her a couple years back \u2026 and she felt confused about it so she had saved it in her notes . Now when I read this my stomach turned \u2026 I feel like everything connected as to why K always acts so weird and obsessed with her sister .\n\nPlease let me know what you think about this situation or  if im simply overreacting.",

When he isn\u2019t drinking, he is the man of my dreams. Sweet, considerate, makes me feel like the luckiest girl in the world. Then he starts to take shots until he is overly intoxicated and slurs his words, can barely walk, super loud, and wants to go out and talk to strangers. We are currently on vacation in Italy and he\u2019s been waking up to take shots in the morning, he isn\u2019t getting himself ready (shower, etc) and it\u2019s really bothering me. By the time that I am ready, he has already killed half the bottle (still has not showered) and way too drunk. It makes me shut down and not want to talk to him, so I start to ignore him and he will say and do anything to pick a fight with me. For some reason, it is always in front of other people when he just wants to \u201ctalk\u201d and that escalates in to an argument. We have been dating for two and a half years, when we first met we would drink and party together but over time we both agreed that we will slow down. In the last two days I had to eat lunch/dinner alone because he refuses to leave the room (he is drinking) and it\u2019s extremely hurtful and lonely. We are staying in a hostel for 2 days and the only thing that motivated him to leave the room was to get another bottle to drink w/ the roommates and to possibly follow them to a bar. We got in to an argument this morning and I was ignoring him and crying while doing my makeup - and he decides to start recording me and when I asked why, he said it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want me to go to the police and lie about him hitting me. (He would never hit me, and I would never do that) so I was confused. It is so draining - we are here in Italy for 16 more days together and i\u2019m not sure if I could handle it. ",

I sent my 1984 F150 (reliable condition, she was my main daily vehicle, driving close to an hour a day with little to no maintenance issues) to get an oil change with a friend of my parents who rebuilds old vehicles and owns a small mechanic workshop in rural Indiana. We were told the truck was ready, and I was able to come pick it up. My mom (name blurred in screen shot) and I drove to go get her. Said family friend was not at the shop when we got there, but we were told the keys were under the seat and she was ready. \nWhen I started her up I noticed she had sounded different. I had assumed she was \u201ctuned up\u201d and running better now, and I was exited. She also had started up right away without me needing to pump the gas, so that supported my assumption. She made it maybe 6 minutes down the road before she completely stalled out and I had to push her to the side of the road. We called the mechanic and he came back with his tow truck. He looked at the motor, checked the oil, and told us there wasn\u2019t any oil in the vehicle at all. He said he\u2019d tow the truck back to the shop to take a look, then let us know what happened. \nI was supposed to leave for Florida the very next morning. We got a call later that night that the engine was completely totaled. I sobbed. (I have a strong attachment for my truck). We went back and forth with him for about a week over the different options. First it was a brand new motor covered by insurance, then a used motor, and finally he told us that he could rebuild it or buy her from us. I chose the rebuild. We were told 8-10 weeks.

        "Background": "i am 19F my bf is 21M ( he turned 21 last week ). So this week has been super hectic for me, I\u2019m an accounting major at a 4yr university, it\u2019s finals week and I managed to make all As this semester. Yesterday was really my first day I had to myself to chill, but my apartment was so messy and cluttered because since my bfs bday was last week I was ordering stuff and packing, long story short I spent the whole day cleaning and making dinner for him when he got off work ( we don\u2019t live together but we spend the night together almost everyday at my apartment or his moms house ) so yesterday I had a migraine, but I still pushed through it because I wanted it clean, and wanted my man to come home to the house clean, smelling nice, and dinner cooked. He got home, we ate, etc, it was time for bed, easier he told me his work clothes needed to be washed bec he didn\u2019t bring a clean uniform so he needed to wear that one tomorrow, so I told him put them in the washer bec I didn\u2019t feel good to get up, he put them in the washer, then later on I noticed they stopped when I was using the bathroom so I put them in the dryer, later when we were going to bed he asked if I put his clothes in the dryer I said yes, he said go check, I told him you go check bec I didn\u2019t feel good, and he didn\u2019t want to go check and I didn\u2019t ether so we went to bed. He wakes up the next morning and the clothes weren\u2019t dry, I never started the washer. I  felt bad abt it, but he was really upset understandably so, he didn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the morning we usually hug and kiss before he leaves, but he just left no words. I later texted him apologizing which is the attachment above, he said it was okay, but then calls me later complaining again saying oh why wouldn\u2019t I start the dryer and why did I say it was his fault ( I didn\u2019t I told him he could have went to go check for HIS CLOTHES) but I should have started the dryer I thought I did, clearly my mind was somewhere else, obviously I wouldn\u2019t intentionally not dry the clothes\u2026 but he kept saying stuff abt it, then saying so you don\u2019t haven\u2019t anything to say ? And I\u2019m just like idk what to say, bec that was hours ago, why are we still talking abt this when I apologized you alr said it\u2019s okay I\u2019m here, but you want to call my phone and go back and forth abt it ? so he was like okay ima ttyl hang up. So I hung up. Idk what more I could have done, I feel bad bec it\u2019s my fault, but I\u2019m just annoyed bec it\u2019s like yes I made a mistake but I was feeling proud of myself for doing all the cleaning, and cooking when I just wanted to rest after school AND WORK. but he\u2019s stuck on this clothes thing and I just want to rebuttal by bring that up, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do, idk if I\u2019m just trying to find and excuse bec I was in the wrong, idk what do yall think ?

        "Background": "Firstly, this came out of nowhere. Then, when he started talking about how I\u2019m immature, I wasn\u2019t sure what to do, so I just reiterated what I\u2019m doing with my life. \n\nWorking full-time and doing a MBA, albeit online. \n\nFor context, he and I started dating under romantic circumstances, he\u2019s not a SD. He looks really young, so I was truly shocked to learn his age. Now I see it\u2019s a mistake, so don\u2019t heckle me for this. \n\nHe is older than me, by 20 years. I am 25 and he is 45. He owns a restaurant and I do remote admin work at a small startup. \n\nAfter dating for just under a year, he asked me to move in with him, as I was stressing about my recent rent increase. I could pay it, but it wrecked my financial planning and it was miserable. I was looking for an out. My rent went from $1850 to $2300, not including utilities. \n\nHe owns his house, so he told me I could live with him if I wanted. He said that I could live here and save up my money, that I can leave whenever I want. No pressure. He invited me, I did not ask nor imply I wanted to move in. \n\nI agreed (horrible mistake). I moved in and now we\u2019re here. He doesn\u2019t make me cover any utilities or charge me rent, which I thought was kind of him. \n\nI use my work phone for work but I\u2019m usually lying down. When I have a meeting, I sit up and answer the call. I\u2019m a solid employee, just doing backup admin work. The pay is nice, can\u2019t complain. \n\nHe started saying I need to step it up in life, after seeing me \u2018leisurely working.\u2019 I chose this job because I worked on my feet since high school, my undergrad, and a bit of my current MBA. I wanted to pivot to a chill job. I chose this job because it is leisurely. I am working from 9am to about 5pm, whereas he works 5pm to 5am. So from his perspective, I\u2019m often asleep or unavailable.\n\nToday, he walked downstairs to work and saw me sitting on the couch. I\u2019ve told him many times I\u2019m working via my phone. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that and makes weird little jabs. \n\nThen, he sent me these messages. \n\nI felt really annoyed because he implies that I am not interested in self improvement, that I\u2019m immature, I\u2019m arrogant, denies that it\u2019s hurtful to say such. \n\nBy the final slide, I decided to call my mom who I felt could offer insight. She\u2019s 40 years older than me, but understands technology. She said it seems like he\u2019s trying to play some kind of game, that I should just ask him why he\u2019s asking all this to me now. He seems to be beating around the bush, which I agree with. \n\nSo, I decide to ask him why he\u2019s treating me like this. \n\nWhen he said he\u2019s talking to me like an adult, outside of text, I exploded inside. Immediately, I felt so angry. \n\nHe invites me to live with him, then holds it above me. He calls me all sorts of things over text, but then denies that he is saying such. He can\u2019t just say what he means. He then doubles down and says he\u2019s just worried about my maturity. \n\nBecause of this, and a conversation we had after, where he ignored all my concerns, didn\u2019t let me speak, and bulldozed the entire way, I\u2019ve decided to move out and find my own place again. He just has zero emotional intelligence. His ex-girlfriend was 50, the other one 55, and his ex-wife was his same age. I thought that meant he wouldn\u2019t be acting like this, in the typical way that men who date younger women do. But I was so wrong. He\u2019s been talking to me like I\u2019m a child, I have no ground to stand on with him. I can\u2019t take it. \n\nHe\u2019s saying that moving out over this is crazy, not based in reality, and that I\u2019m losing a really good chance at stability. That he loves me and that I shouldn\u2019t go, because if I do, I\u2019ll just have to go back to paying crazy rent. He recently got me a brand new TV and WiFi, so I do feel badly for wanting to leave even after that. I feel bad for making him stress, but he doesn\u2019t seem to care that I\u2019m stressed. \n\nAm I overreacting by moving out and ending the relationship? ",

        "Background": "BACKGROUND:\n\nMy roommate (let\u2019s call her R) and I met in our first year of college (last year). My scheduled roommate never showed up last year, so I had the room to myself. By spring semester, the college said we needed to either buy out our room or find a new roommate. R and I agreed we\u2019d room together bc she and her roommate had a falling out and her roommate moved out. Then room selection comes and R says \u201coh I roomed with someone else bc I thought you were going to buy out the room.\u201d I never said I was going to, I said my mom SUGGESTED it, but also that we\u2019d decided that it was too expensive and not worth it. I ended up rooming with E (referred to in the texts as \u201cprevious mutual roommate\u201d) for the spring.\n\nOver summer, all 3 of us (me, R, E) agreed to room in a triple for this year. E ended up leaving college at the end of last semester, so R and I stayed in the triple together (no extra costs/buy outs). R has always been kinda uptight and a neat freak, but I\u2019m generally agreeable and will just do whatever the other person wants, especially when living with them, to avoid any issues. E was usually a mediator of sorts between me and R whenever R would get upset that the room was messy. R would also get mad at E for E\u2019s desk being messy, clothes being on the floor, pairs of shows not being together, etc.\n\nSince E left, R has gotten much worse. R and I are rarely in the room, we\u2019re usually in class/practice/work or at our bfs\u2019 houses. However, I sleep here and spend more time in the room than she does. I can\u2019t remember the last time she slept here, or was even in here for more than 30min. She\u2019s always saying that *I\u2019m* the one who\u2019s never here and complains that I leave messes everywhere (I\u2019m a more messy person but I do clean up after myself and others and keep my messes confined to my personal areas). She quite literally boxed me in by taping a square around the corner where my desk/closet are and told me I \u201ccan\u2019t have a mess outside this area\u201d and constantly complains when something is *touching the tape.*\n\nMy bf (J) was here one night and R came in to pick up some things before going to her bf\u2019s house. J and I were playing Xbox and actively eating, so we had a bag and wrappers/boxes in front of both of us. R immediately complained, saying \u201cyou need to make sure you clean up that mess.\u201d She always uses this condescending, passive aggressive, \u201cjoking\u201d tone when complaining.\n\nSTORY:\n\nI stayed with my bf for 2w (he lives near my college in PA) after spring break because my car broke down at home in VA and the keychain had my dorm key and campus ID. When I finally came back last Thursday, I invited a couple friends over for game night after our night class (which I\u2019ve invited R to multiple times and she always has an excuse to not come). We played drinking games in our room, R was not there, and I let her know it was happening. The next morning, I get asked if I\u2019ve seen R\u2019s goose, why things are moved on her desk, how things got out of her desk drawer, etc. The texts above reiterate that I didn\u2019t touch her stuff, the only thing I touched that night was the black knit book bc I moved it back from the edge of her desk so it wouldn\u2019t fall.\n\nOne friend left while I was awake (lives in her van, sleep there for the night), the other had passed out an hour prior to that and I\u2019d put a blanket on her. I cleaned up as best as I could (that was the first time I\u2019ve ever been *actually* drunk) and packed the last friend\u2019s bag so she didn\u2019t have to worry in the morning if she woke up late. There were a couple spills of caprisun and fireball throughout the night, but we cleaned them up right when they happened. R sent texts complaining about the room being sticky, and I said I\u2019d re-clean the whole area.\n\nE and I scheduled that Fri-Sun for her to come up and visit. I told R in advance (1-2w) but then a few days before E came, R said she had a recruit for her sport coming to visit from Fri-Sat. She immediately lectured me about not drinking, smoking, cursing, or making any jokes around the recruit bc \u201cshe\u2019s just a junior.\u201d I agreed and hid everything (despite thinking it\u2019s stupid to act like a 16/17yo is a toddler who will snitch if someone says \u201cfuck\u201d). I reiterated that E was here the whole weekend starting on Fri, but R then said her mom was coming for Sat-Sun. I told her that as long as the recruit and R\u2019s mom aren\u2019t both here by the time we go to sleep, it would be no issue. I told R and E that I\u2019d take the floor, the recruit and R\u2019s mom could take the 3rd bed, and E could have my bed.\n\nE came on Fri and we hung out, then the recruit came and R immediately lectured both of us (again). I was on ft with J, and R said \u201chang up on him. I don\u2019t want him to make the recruit uncomfortable.\u201d He and I weren\u2019t even talking, we were just idly on ft and neither of us were paying attention to each other. We always fall asleep on ft/discord if we\u2019re not together. I protested and told her all of this, but she still said I needed to hang up, so I backed down and ended the call. Come 9pm, R is already saying her and the recruit need to sleep, so now E and I have to also sleep. 9pm is also when I take my Lexapro, and I take Temazepam to sleep ~30min before going to bed. The issue was, I couldn\u2019t find my meds.\n\nR turned off all of the lights as I was actively looking for my meds. I suggested turning on my LEDs (phone controlled) bc she turned on her desk light (bright as hell btw). She agreed but kept her desk on so I plugged in my LEDs. Barely 2min later, she unplugs my LEDs (she often unplugs my stuff bc she \u201cdoesn\u2019t like it dangling above the bed\u201d since she\u2019s on bottom bunk and the only outlet near me is on the wall at the middle of her bed, despite me making the wires tight against the wall/my bunk\u2019s springs).\n\nR kept rushing me and pushing, and eventually made me give up looking for them. I climbed into my bed and immediately started having a breakdown, so I texted my bf and eventually he told me to come over. I felt bad leaving E and she woke up when I left (around 11ish) asking where I was going. I said \u201cI\u2019m sad\u201d and she understood. I offered her my bed again, but she said she didn\u2019t want to risk falling off the top bunk.\n\nI came back the next day and E told me R cancelled her mom coming over bc \u201csomething came up.\u201d Whatever, her choice. J invited me to a baseball game on Sun and E said I should go bc E wanted to hang out with some other friends before she left. I found my meds and was able to sleep in the dorm with E (R was at her bf\u2019s house). The next day, I left for the game and R apparently came back while I was gone and saw E in the room (refer to texts where she said I was \u201cMIA\u201d).\n\nThe entire time E was there, R kept complaining about how the recruit might feel uncomfortable (as if this wouldn\u2019t be how the room worked if E had stayed this semester) and was very short and cold towards E. E was becoming uncomfortable and we talked about it, agreeing that R was being an ass in that moment.\n\nA couple nights ago, I was going to bed and I heard a shattering sound. I turned over and saw shiny pieces on the floor and hopped down to clean it up. I texted R that her turtle broke, and then immediately fell asleep. Then these texts came throughout the day. The pic of her desk is taken from my bed. As you can see, it\u2019s cluttered with breakable things at the edge (which I\u2019m always pushing back to avoid anything falling). You can see the only 3 pieces of the turtle that were salvageable, the rest was shards and practically dust. I ended up getting holes in my foot from cleaning it up.\n\n\nTLDR; my roommate constantly complains about my mess and literally boxed me into a space, believes I broke her trinkets even tho I didn\u2019t, and makes me out to be a bad person.\n",

        "Background": "So here\u2019s the situation. I live with 4 people - my wife, her brother, and our best friend. The problem is her brother. For years now (like 5 years running), we have had to remind him over and over to clean his room because the smell coming out of it is nasty, almost like a rat nest type of odor. If you know, you know. We have always had the general rule that we do not go into each other\u2019s spaces, and I stick to that.\n\nToday though, things went differently. He left to go play DND with his friends. While he was gone, a storm rolled in with heavy rain and extreme winds. I got concerned because his room is on the third floor and I could see from outside that his window looked open. I tried to be respectful and check from the outside first, but sure enough, it was wide open. Rain was blowing straight into the wall and soaking everything.\n\nAt that point, I figured the reasonable thing to do was go in and shut it. I went in, closed the window, and left. I did not snoop, I did not touch anything else, literally went straight to the window and back out. The reason is simple = we rent, and all of us are on the lease. I am not trying to deal with water damage or mold spreading because of his negligence.\n\nBut when I walked in, I could not ignore what I saw. The room is basically a biohazard zone. Trash piled everywhere. Old food rotting on the carpet. Mold. The stench was insane. When we moved in, the landlord had just put in brand new carpet. His room\u2019s carpet is now completely trashed, like ruined beyond saving. And that is where I am freaking out a bit: since we are all on the lease, is this going to come back on me when we move out?\n\nNow here\u2019s where things really blew up. My wife and I agreed that it needed to be addressed, but she felt it would be better coming from me rather than her, since he tends to blow up at her. We know he has bouts of depression, and we tried to approach this as gently as possible. We sent him a message explaining why I went in, what I saw, and that the room absolutely has to be cleaned and reset, even offering to help if he needed it.\n\nHis response? Completely out of line. He snapped back saying if I ever go into his room again we will have serious problems. He told me he does not care if the entire house is on fire, nobody should go in his room. He accused me of violating his space and basically made it clear that even if the room floods, burns, or fills with flies, it is his and I need to stay out forever. I felt threatened after this.\n\nTo me, this was the final straw. It is not even just this one thing. He routinely says horrible things to his sister (my wife), hitting her in her most self conscious spots and making her cry. He barely holds down work, he can barely pay rent as it is, and now we are faced with knowing the carpets are ruined and he will not be able to reimburse us even though he has already agreed in the past that he would cover any damages he causes.\n\nSo, am I crazy here? Was my text unreasonable, or was his reply way out of line? And second, how worried should I be about being financially responsible for his disgusting room when we move out, since the whole lease is in all of our names?",

        "Background": "I (29F) have been close friends with Lizzy (28F) for 7 years. We met right after college when she was dating one of my work friends, and when they broke up, I stayed friends with her. We did everything together! We were so close, I would call her my sister when we went out or met new people.\n\nIn 2021, I had to move away from where we lived for work, and when I left, I introduced her to a guy  that I had dated for a few weeks in 2020 before amicably breaking up. I did not set them up in a romantic way, but the guy -- we can call him Liam (33M) -- needed someone to play on his rec kickball team and Lizzy is athletic and loves all things sports. \n\nThey started dating in late 2021. I was VERY supportive of them!! I was so happy to see Lizzy happy. Liam and I would NOT have worked out, and I had no feelings for him whatsoever. I sent them an engagement gift when they got engaged from across the country. I have only ever felt joy for them, until Lizzy told me that he made her convert to Christianity for him. That was my first red flag.\n\nI never received an invitation for their wedding. I was a little hurt, but it was ok-- I understood it may have been weird,  I was very busy with work (I work in environments where I lose cell connection for months at a time, so I lost touch with a good many friends), and it was at the end of COVID, when wedding rules were up to interpretation by couples. I never brought it up because I did not really think too much of it at the time. After all, covid was a crazy few years!\n\nFast forward to present day. I am in a new job where I have time and cell connectivity to talk to my friends and I set to work reconnecting with my core group, including Lizzy. She is very evasive and we do chat every few weeks by phone (she by this point lived 6 time zones away), but never consistently. She never seems happy-- always talking about how she is \"ashamed\" of being young and partying in her early 20s, talking about how supportive Liam was when she dropped out of her college courses \"because I was too dumb and scatterbrained,\" and that he was the one who made her realize that she was probably too lazy for college. I have been trying to get her to see that kind of behavior as manipulative and unhealthy, but she says, \"he is just always honest with me, even when it hurts. It's best for me.\" \n\nI hadn't heard from her in a few months, which wasn't insane because she was moving across the country. BUT--\n\nI texted her to get a new address for her so I could send her a save the date for my wedding. \n\nShe sends me the texts attached. Names + numbers have been changed. The weirdest thing to me is that I see Liam at work every now and then and he has NEVER, NOT ONCE hinted to me that he is uncomfortable with my presence. We aren't great friends, but amicable and engage in small talk.\n\nI am really worried about her-- I think that Liam is putting pressure on her to end the friendship with me and that makes me very concerned.

Sure, if it's a big vehicle like a work truck, or a car and trailer, that's totally acceptable. But SO MANY PEOPLE who drive a car less than half the length of the two parks decide to park RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE with half a car length in front and behind.\n\nYesterday, I got home from a long, stressful day of work, and, once again, found myself staring at a normal sized car taking up two spaces, with not a single spot anywhere near me. After half an hour of circling the block (it was a busy Friday evening) I finally found a park, got home, wrote this note, and taped it to their driver's window.\n\nI know they aren't doing it to piss me off, but good lord, was that cathartic.\n\nI cannot park in my driveway, as it is shared between several units and this would block my neighbour's access.\n\nAm I overreacting?",

        "Background": "(yes it's a very long but juicy tea, yes there's a TLDR, and no it could not have been more winnowed down)\n\nSOOOOOO I'm 21F, i met this guy on hinge. He has looking for a long term relationship in his profile. We switched to Instagram and i got overwhelmed with dating apps and wasn't exactly talking to anyone but this guy kept pursuing me. I thought fine, if he's so persistent he must be really into me and he looks decent and has a nice vibe too so why not give it a try? So after like a month or so of exchanging Instagrams, we finally actually start talking (early aug). We have an insane vibe match, great flirting and we soon go on a first date. The date goes great. A lot of exploring the city, laughing, flirting, he's making me blush, I'm making him blush, awesome banter etc. He kept clicking my pictures and calling me pretty and I'm like wow he's a genuinely nice guy. My friends disapproved of him btw, said he doesn't look good and \"I can't be seen outside with him\"\ud83d\ude2d But he is very very chalant which i loved and was a jacked nerd which is exactly my type.\n\nNow, i don't let that stop me and go on a second date.  We went to mkt and while we're having a good time, two of my college classmates pop up at the table next to us while that guy and me we're kinda cozy and they spot me and say my name out loud. It was SOO EMBARASSING because they did not know that i had broken up with my ex 3 months ago since we had a vacation before the semester started and we obviously weren't in contact. THEY THOUGHT I WAS CHEATING \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d and I had to explain to them that I've broken up with my ex and that I'll speak to them later. We rush out of that restaurant and go elsewhere and had dessert there. We ended up having a deep conversation about what we look for in a partner, what were our deal breakers etc. It was going great so far. We pay the bill and step out and towards the door, i see my ex bestfriend.\ud83e\udd21\n\nI hold the guys hand and sprint us out of the bakery. We now decided to head to the mall and while going to the metro station, his colleague comes up to him. ATP I WAS SURE THE NEXT PERSON I SEE IS GOING TO BE A RELATIVE. lol. Now we head to the mall and he tries to kiss me in the metro elevator. I PULLED AWAY. Because why would someone try to kiss you for the first time in a metro elevator that opens in 10 seconds??? It got a little awkward after that but the awkwardness faded out after like 15-20 minutes. We ended the date by getting coffee and talking some more and listening to music with wired earphones. It was cute. I was happy. By now, we've talked about what we're looking for, what we look for in a partner and things like that.\n\nI told him I'm not into casuals and he said he wasn't looking for one either. \nNow we're talking on hour long calls, texting everyday, giving mundane life updates everyday, i started liking all of this.\nThen came the third date. He lives with his flatmates in the outskirts (ncr) because of his job so he invited me home and we had built up enough chemisty for me to say yes now. Rare occasion. I go to his place, i took flowers for him and his reaction to that was \"come on, now i feel bad\". he cooks me food, we watch a show, do stuff (just up until second base, he asked for more and i declined) listen to music and we had a lot of fun. He drops me at the metro station and I get back home. \n\nWe have now entered october. \nNow comes dussehra and he goes to his hometown for that. Things are busy and we aren't able to plan another date because the first weekend he's at home, second weekend he has plans, third weekend was diwali. and also my 21st birthday (18th oct) he had a train on my birthday and i decided to celebrate by throwing a girl's sleepover on 17th night because there was another festival on the 18th. \n\nWe had this thing where we like diabolical reels on ig and then reply to each other's likes in a banter. He had liked a reel that said \"when I'm about to lock in but then i remember who's ovulating\" and i replied to that with the eyes emoji. we have a conversation over it and i say \"i wonder if that was for me tho\" and that mf proceeds to say \"valid doubt\ud83e\udd23\" and i get so pissed. I don't do casuals and he knew that. I said don't waste my time if that's the case and he says \"if what's the case???\" Now i was PISSED. I held onto my cool and calmly said \"if you've got a roster, go play but out of my dms\" to which he very casually says \"to think I'd have the time to maintain a roster\ud83d\ude2d\" and i was like \" i don't have one reason to believe that\" and that mf goes \"i can say the same about you\" LIKE?!?! i ask him \"literally how???\" he ignores the question and the conversation takes another route. \n\nNow it's around 10 pm on 17th and my friends have come, we're getting ready and I'm not on my phone. Around 12:15, he comes up and wishes me \"Happy birthday babygirl i hope you're having fun\" no emojis, no extra letters, i felt bad but i still thanked him as soon as i saw that text. He had started telling me whenever he had plans so i assumed he didn't have any tonight since he has a train to catch tomorrow morning but boy was i wrong. \n\n\nIt's now 5 am, I'm absolutely down in the dumps drunk, we proceed to the kitchen to make maggi where i pick up my phone to make a snap vlog for memories and i see he has uploaded a story on snap, which has never happened so far and my first thought was that it must've been an accident cuz it has happened to me a lot. I open the story and it's some club, the camera rotates and he's there at a diwali party in a kurta with a dupatta around his neck, two girls are standing next to him, he turns his head and kisses the girl. Now mind you i was absolutely trashed here. I screenrecorded that story, removed him from my snap and my private account and text him on whatsapp. one single word. \"asshole.\" he doesn't reply, OBVIOUSLY, he had no defence.\n\n Later that day, around 8 pm i post my birthday pictures on my main account and as you would've guessed, i get a text back (the screenshot) I never replied to that text. Bro wasn't sorry that he kissed the girl, his only regret was me seeing it so now he couldn't play me anymore.\n\n\nHis ego gets hurt since I'm not writing long ass paragraphs asking for answers and he puts up a reel on his story that says \"the lion doesn't drink so he doesn't remember, the lion drinks so everyone remembers\" it pissed me off and posted a story on that audio \"whatever makes you feel better\" with the caption \"whatever makes you feel manly\ud83e\udd70\" i knew i got his ego. \n\nThis man beat all levels of petty. He then proceeded to post a story with the girl he had kissed in the video and hid her face with a song OFC. But me being the silly little detective that i am, found that girl in his following and also found her private acc so he definitely didn't just meet her in the club. I got so confused thinking if i should text the girl warning her because what if she was his girlfriend and he cheated on her with me?? But then that girl didn't repost his story so i thought maybe not lol. Anyways, why are men like this?? I straight up asked him if he was seeing other people and he dodged it and proceeded to give me the best birthday gift possible. GOOD RIDDANCE. \n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR;\n\nI (21F) was pursued by a persistent guy I met on Hinge who was looking for a long term relationship. Despite my friends' disapproval of his looks, i went out with him because our vibe really matched. This is early aug. \n\nWent on three dates. The first was amazing. Second was great as well but got a little awkward cuz he tried to kiss me in a metro elevator and i pulled away. the date ended up being cute regardless. The third one was at his place and things got a little heated (didn't go far from second base). \n\nAfter this, we started talking on long calls, updating each other about mundane things, video calls, texting all the time etc.\n\nWe've now entered oct. Since there were so many festivals, we both had busy schedules and couldn't plan a fourth date.\nMy birthday was on the 18th. On 17th, things got a little tense when I asked him if he was seeing other people and he deflected the question saying he doesn't have the time to maintain a roster. I had a girls sleepover planned on 17th night so I wasn't texting back much because I was busy attendinh my friends. \n\nLater that night he sent a dry ass birthday wish saying \"happy birthday babygirl i hope ur having fun\" with no emojis or extra letters but i let it slide. I wasn't aware of any of his plans and he had a train to catch in the morning. I got very drunk that night. I saw his snap story at 5 am. The story was of a club where he kissed a girl standing next to him. It was obviously uploaded accidentally. Then i removed him from my snap and priv account and then sent the text in the screenshot (his reply was after i posted my birthday pictures 18th evening)\n\nHe beat all levels of petty and posted a story that said \"the lion doesn't drink so he doesn't remember, the lion drinks so everyone remembers\" it pissed me off and posted a story on that audio \"whatever makes you feel better\" with the caption \"whatever makes you feel manly\ud83e\udd70\" i knew i got his ego. \n\nHe then proceeded to post a story with the girl he had kissed in the video and hid her face with a song OFC. I found the girl's account and thought of texting her cuz what if he was her boyfriend and cheated on her with me but she didn't repost that story so i let it go.

        "Background": "So idk if I\u2019m overreacting here or not, but here\u2019s what happened.\n\nI (M 24) was at my gf\u2019s (F 23) place this weekend.  (We live 4 hours apart so we take turns to visit each other every weekend.) She went out with her friends Saturday night, told me she\u2019d be back \u201csoon.\u201d She left at like 8:30pm. Didn\u2019t come back until 5 in the morning. I was in the kids\u2019 room, watching Hulu, fell asleep waiting for her.\n\nWhen she finally comes in at 5am, she just lays down next to me like it\u2019s totally normal. I didn\u2019t hug her back, just asked where her daughter was. (Love the 2 of them as my own.) Later the alarm goes off, she moves to the other room and that was it.\n\nNow backstory: not long ago I almost ended the relationship because she was pulling this same type of stuff. She promised me, on her own, that she wouldn\u2019t be hitting bars/clubs unless I was there. That\u2019s her words, not mine. And then she just does it anyway.\n\nSo by the time I saw her roll in at 5am, I thought about it and decided I should go home early (I typically spend Sunday there and arrive home at night. At 6:30am I grabbed my stuff (ok I forgot my wallet and work uniform but whatever. I have more uniforms, and honestly, Apple Pay\u2019s been saving my life this week lol) and drove 4 hours back to my city. Didn\u2019t say a word. She blew up my phone up nonstop all morning. 18 missed calls, texts saying \u201cplease,\u201d \u201cwhat happened?,\u201d \u201cI love you.\u201d She even turned off location sharing after.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing tho\u2026 the reason I didn\u2019t stay to \u201ctalk it out\u201d face to face is because she has this pattern: she\u2019ll minimize everything, make excuses, and act like she didn\u2019t really do anything wrong. Like she plays dumb or innocent, but deep down she knows what she\u2019s doing. If I had stayed, I know she would\u2019ve twisted it into \u201cyou\u2019re exaggerating\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d So I left to avoid a pointless discussion. Actions > words.\n\nAfter seeing how playing innocent and trying to get me to answer her with \u201cyou forgot your wallet and your work clothes,\u201d she says don\u2019t need \u201cspace,\u201d I need coherence. If you promise me something, follow through. If you say you\u2019ll be home \u201csoon,\u201d don\u2019t walk in at 5am. If you say I\u2019m a priority, then act like it.\n\nNow I\u2019m conflicted bc I do care about her kids and want to see them. I went to her city this past weekend, and I expect her to come to mine this upcoming weekend. If she doesn\u2019t, that tells me everything I need to know.\n\nSo\u2026 AIO for leaving at 6am without saying a word and ghosting her calls/messages? Or was that the only way to actually get my point across since talking never works with her?\n",

        "Background": "Grab a drink, this is a loaded one. My ex (M 30) and I (F 30) had been dating for about 9 months but we\u2019ve known each other for about 18 years. We\u2019ve always been in and out of each other\u2019s lives and just have always shared this weird connection. We were always close friends and I\u2019ve always loved him. For context, before we dated, about 2 years prior he had been married to his last ex whom he told me was a very toxic relationship and she was very mentally unstable, but that they had continued being intimate even after everything and leading up to shortly before we started dating. I ended up finding out early on in our relationship that he was actually still in contact with her, mainly her bombarding him but him still interacting, and after we spoke about it he ended up changing his phone number and his email. But while dating, some anxious trust issues were coming up stemming from that tie to his ex and even though it would be brought up, we never really actively worked on it and discussed it deeper together. Around August he told me he had been talking to via insta DM an \u201cold platonic girl friend\u201d of his but I just had a bad feeling about it. I ended up going into his instagram and finding the conversation reaching disrespectful in certain things he was saying to her and entertaining from her. They would talk about sexual things and he would just constantly be giving her reassurance for her image and it was just crossing the line. For example at one point she said: \u201ccan you imagine having me and not wanting to f**k me?\u201d To which he replied \u201cin the most appropriate way possible, no I can\u2019t\u201d. At another point he also told her \u201cunder any other circumstance, I would wife you up\u201d, and it was just several back and forth things that were very flirty and crossing the line. At this point we were about to leave on my birthday trip to Europe so I didn\u2019t know how to bring it up, and I was planning on waiting until we got back. Towards the end of our trip we got really drunk one night and I ended up telling him what I had seen. It ended up a huge blowout where he was angry at me for invading his privacy again and that he wasn\u2019t \u201cflirting\u201d and saying anything wrong and that he wanted to end the relationship. I told him that I wanted us to work through things, because clearly boundaries weren\u2019t established on my end, I basically just expected those types of things to be respected, and I could respect his boundary for privacy but it shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of disrespecting me in private. We ended up ultimately breaking up (his choice) but he\u2019s continually told me that he still loves and adores me and believes this isn\u2019t the end of our story, that he hopes we can heal on our own. But literally only 2 weeks after us breaking up and him telling me all these things still constantly, he ended up going out to the beach one night with the same girl he was DM\u2019ing on IG but he said to me that nothing happened. Then a few days after THAT I found out he had ended up hooking up with his \u201ccrazy toxic ex\u201d just a couple days after having gone to the beach with this other girl. We talked about it and initially he blew up on me saying that he doesn\u2019t owe me anything and that I don\u2019t need any truth from him and how he chooses to heal isn\u2019t my problem and he just got really nasty with some other things said, but then came and apologized to me the next day saying that he\u2019s just been angry and hurt and is mad at himself for how he\u2019s gone about things and he knows it\u2019s not right and that he still feels all the ways he told me he feels about me. I feel like I\u2019ve had A LOT of reasons to be upset over what he\u2019s done and how he\u2019s spoken to me, but it keeps coming off as if I\u2019m the only one who messed up by invading his privacy? I also think that I do deserve the transparency and honesty because he\u2019s still here telling me how much he loves and adores me etc? It just feels to me now as if I never really mattered by the way he\u2019s moved following the breakup and when I\u2019ve tried explaining my side to it or my feelings he just seems to defend his side in it or how it\u2019s not only him who\u2019s done things. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s looking at this objectively at all. Am I overreacting to the post breakup feels??",

The session day and time constantly change according to her schedule, and I\u2019ve always tried to accommodate her availability. She also never sends any reminders or confirmations. This week, I had our session scheduled for Friday at 6pm, based on what I remember her saying in our last session. I\u2019ve never written a time incorrectly in my calendar before and I even had that same slot blocked out for the next few Fridays. I specifically remember her initiating the idea of switching to Fridays for a few weeks, and I adjusted my schedule for that.\n\nThen on Thursday, I received a text from her saying, \u201cOur appointment was at 4pm today\u201dwhich completely blindsided me. I replied that I had it down for tomorrow at 6, and felt confused, but I still apologized. She then responded, \u201cI have a ongoing client at 6pm on Thursdays, so I don\u2019t know how that could\u2019ve happened.\u201d Which made no sense, I never mentioned Thursday. I clearly said I had it down for the following day. She still expected payment due to her no show policy. I told her I was so confused and that I remember the conversation about switching to Fridays. She has not responded to me at all since and it\u2019s been days now.\n\nThis also isn\u2019t the first time there\u2019s been a scheduling or communication issue. A few weeks ago, she told me we might have a session on a Friday, but said she\u2019d let me know at the start of the week depending on whether she went on a yoga retreat. I was already frustrated at the time because she couldn\u2019t give me a definite answer then, but I still kept the day open just in case. I didn\u2019t hear anything from her the entire week. The day before, I texted \u201cHi, I\u2019m assuming we don\u2019t have a session tomorrow?\u201d to which all she replied was \u201ccorrect\u201d. It was so curt and came off like it was something I should\u2019ve already known?? There was no acknowledgment or apology for her lack of follow-up, even though I was the one left hanging the entire week. I feel like it\u2019s walking on egg shells when it comes to communicating over text.\n\nShe\u2019s also pressured me a few times to pay more than my agreed sliding scale (I\u2019ve been paying the lowest rate, which is still relatively expensive but is what I can afford right now), and when I asked to go biweekly instead of weekly, she told me that \u201cI needed more therapy than that.\u201d That comment felt manipulative and made me question whether it was truly about my well-being or her income.\n\nI want to cut ties with her because of all of this but I feel completely disregarded. I still got charged for something I don\u2019t even think I was fully at fault for and got absolutely nothing but complete silence in return. Am I overreacting? ",

Wha happened is in the morning I was messing around with puff pastry and I had left over egg wash so I added milk and cinnamon and made french toast. I was about to eat when my sister came and asked to try some. I said fine and let her have some. She said it was nice and I said yeah. She asked if I could make her one and I said no. She asked again and again and I stuck to my answer. My mum said she\u2019d make her French toast so I left for my room. Later on I got a string of messages from her.\n\nShe\u2019s never treated me nicely as I\u2019m three ish years younger. She took me to miniso because she said she would. I didn\u2019t ask she just said on Friday we would go to miniso. I bought her a sandwich for her troubles. She only makes me food if she\u2019s making some for herself and just has to make a little extra for me. I blocked her cause this really is just the last straw for me. I\u2019m not whiney and the \u2018accommodations\u2019 are for my depression and probable autism. I cry a lot cause I just can\u2019t help it. If I feel unhappy in a situation I cry. I can\u2019t control or get the tears to stop. I\u2019ve tried but nothing. She\u2019s not accommodating at all for the record.\n\nEdit: I feel I need to add more context. No I don\u2019t like my sister at all so this could have been spiteful due to my currents hatred for her. Yeah I\u2019m not denying that but putting that aside cause that\u2019s not even why I said no. I just felt extremely sick and had just finished making my food and the idea and getting all the stuff out and making another one that I wouldn\u2019t even get to enjoy just didn\u2019t sound appealing to me. I don\u2019t even like my sister so why am I wasting my time. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t do things for her. I actually planned to make Mac and cheese and leave extra for her like I always do. We don\u2019t like a lot of the same things and the things I cook she rarely ever likes. I kid you not it\u2019s only Mac and cheese she likes and I only like spaghetti. She makes spaghetti once a week for the house. I am currently sick. The things she does for me is make spaghetti once a week for the house. That\u2019s pretty much it. I don\u2019t do a whole lot for her either but I\u2019m not the one claiming I do. I understand her PoV a lil more now so thanks. But no it\u2019s not like she cooks me alone dinner all the time while I do nothing. Sometimes I do say yes and I do things sometimes. She does the classic older sister \u2018can you get me this\u2019 and I used to do it all the time and then I realised she\u2019s the worst and I don\u2019t owe her anything. You don\u2019t have to see my pov I only posted on Reddit to se if I was in the wrong completely. I don\u2019t really want to explain everything she does she just isn\u2019t generally all that nice. She\u2019s nice sometimes and she does do nice things occasionally but that doesn\u2019t cover up years and erasing my self worth so I\u2019m not all about doing nice things for her. Maybe I am the asshole and I\u2019m open to that possibility. I can\u2019t handle criticism lmao but I mean if it\u2019s more constructive rather that \u2018you\u2019re an ungrateful selfish brat\u2019 then yeah I get it. I don\u2019t think I made any sense but yeah\n\nEdit again: I would much rather she say no to me then say yes when she doesn\u2019t want to just to weaponise that against me later. ",

He\u2019s my favorite of all time, and it\u2019s hard for me to even understand any arguments against him being the best. Fast & Furious, The Meg, The Expendables(4 is my favorite) & most recently The Beekeeper are some of the best films cinema has to offer. I even have a Jason Statham poster that she wouldn\u2019t let me hang in our room, so I put it in our guest bathroom which is the only place I can take a shit now because instead of hearing my girlfriend nag me about being on the toilet too long, I\u2019m motivated by the loudest silence I have ever experienced. Pooping in front of my Jason Statham poster is like having a 1 on 1 guru coaching me through my bowel movement. Anyway, she liked The Meg but reducted the rest to \u201cbro\u201d movies\u2026 which I find pretty offensive by itself but was willing to look past that. What feels like the final straw though is when I finally felt like she was ready to be shown my favorite and the best movie ever, Crank: High Voltage\u2026 I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. Based on her review in the screenshot provided and the conversation we had after, she didn\u2019t get it at all. I thought I had taught her enough to follow high-octane thinkers like C:HV, but I\u2019m starting to worry she might just be too vanilla or dull to comprehend the intricate nuances the directors wove into the plot or Jason into his performance. I slept in my truck last night because I couldn\u2019t even be near her after so rudely shooting down something I love so much, but its been broken down for over a month so I\u2019m close to freezing trying to hold out and just don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve been in between jobs for a few years now, so she pays all the rent\u2026 but I have nowhere to go, so I\u2019m thinking about asking her to get a hotel room for herself while I take some time to think. I know it\u2019s just a movie to some people, but to me\u2026 Crank: High Voltage is a lot deeper than just some random film. Am I Overreacting?",

I got super nervous but I had to leave for work so I decided I would talk to her about it when I got home. \n\nI bring home a pack of condoms and she gets visibly upset asking what's wrong. I gently tell her I found out she had missed some of her pills.

She told me that it's true that she had missed some of her pills and that she was going to tell me but that we didn't need to use condoms because \"nothing was going to happen\". I told her that I didn't feel comfortable with that and she said she'd rather not have sex than have sex with a condom because it \"doesn't feel the same\". I tell her fine, then we can do other things to be intimate while she gets back on track. \n\nWe start watching a tv show but I can tell she's still upset so I ask what's wrong. She starts telling me how all her friends are getting pregnant/having kids and that if she ever wants to have some she better start trying now. This obviously catches me off guard so I tell her that that had never been on my plans. She tells me she just recently started thinking about it after we had attended two of her friends' gender reveal parties and admitted she had been skipping her birth control pills on purpose. \n\nI told her I needed some time to think about our relationship and went to stay at a friend's house. It's now been a week since I left and she's begging me to come back but I honestly feel betrayed plus I'm super nervous that I might have already gotten her pregnant due to her missing so many pills while we were having unprotected sex that whole week.\n\nAIO for thinking I can never trust her again?

It\u2019s about a 20 minute drive. I text her before I leave and then call her while I am getting gas. I let her know the roads are kinda bad so I might take a bit but I\u2019ll text or call her when I get there, want to focus on the roads. \n\nLucky not to many people were on the road so leaving at 8 I got there around 8:20. I text her let her know I am here while waiting in her drive way. I text again asking if she feel asleep. I decide to call her. No answer. So I walk up to the door and knock. No answer. I knock again a bit harder cause the door is wood and the door bell isn\u2019t working and the door opens. I say hello and walk in and talk my shoes off and head for the stairs right beside the door to see if she is sleeping. \n\nRight as I get to the stairs I see her walking out of her male roommates room with the light off wearing nothing but a pair of see through black panties with a string at the back and a sweater. \n\nMy face just goes blank. She looks at me and says \u201coh shit, this looks bad\u201d while giggling. I just stand there and she goes \u201cit\u2019s nothing, he is just a friend, come to my room.\u201d I stand there for a about a minute shocked, then go to her room and sit in the chair. She was saying shit to me like it\u2019s nothing, but tbh I really wasn\u2019t thinking. After about 3 minutes of trying to convince me nothing happened she goes into her bed and goes to sleep. \n\nI sit there three hours saying nothing waiting for her to wake up. Finally just before midnight I couldn\u2019t do it anymore and left. \n\nAt about 4 am I get a text from her saying I am sorry I feel asleep. Nothing about walking out of his room like that. \n\nThe next 3 hours have been her saying, I don\u2019t know what I am talking about, nothing happened, she didn\u2019t cheat, what she did wasn\u2019t highly inappropriate even if she didn\u2019t cheat, she was just in there to see the dogs and charge her phone cause it died, she always walks around the house and goes in there with no pants on (even though I have never seen it, that I am just being emotional, and so much more. \n\nThen she said I should talk to the guy who\u2019s room she came out of and he tried to say he saw nothing wrong with it. Oh, and btw she has told me \n\nNow I feel like I have been pretty good letting her be freinds with this guy, Go in his room alone, I even let her sleep in there either the dogs without saying a thing. Oh btw she tells me all the time how he wants to fuck her but they are just friends.\n\nI am pretty livid also about that fact that we just talked about how her dad was cheated on by her mother and how it devastated him and all she is telling me is I am a pussy cause I am over reacting.\n\nAm I over reacting. \nShould this be considered cheating? \nIs it high inappropriate regardless. I wasn\u2019t going to break up with her if she had apologized and said she would never do it again, but now I don\u2019t think I can ever trust her again. \n\nI have added the first couple texts but there are a lot more.

        "Background": "My boyfriend [27m] and I [23f] have been dating for over four years. When we started dating, he had a friend named Ann. Ann is an extrovert\u2014very bubbly\u2014and I liked her at first. However, she was especially flirty with my boyfriend.\n\nEarly in the relationship, something happened that left me uneasy. I asked if I could stop by his place, and he said no. Later, I saw on his status that Ann was there. When I confronted him about it, he responded, 'Were you hungry? Is that why you wanted to stop by?' I explained that wasn\u2019t the case\u2014it just felt like he chose to spend his day with her instead of me. He later said it was a pop-up visit because she needed help fixing her laptop (he works in IT).\n\nAfter that, I told him I was uncomfortable with how close they were. I thought we had moved past it. But later, I found out he had asked her for a lot of advice about our relationship and even brought up inappropriate topics with her. I confronted him again and once again expressed how uncomfortable I was with their friendship.\n\nAfter the second incident, I didn\u2019t hear anything about her, and I assumed it was behind us. Then, earlier this week, he mentioned that he saw her at the gym. I said, 'Okay, that\u2019s fine,' though I did feel a bit uneasy since they hadn\u2019t spoken in a while.\n\nYesterday, I was at his place\u2014I\u2019ve been living here for around two years now\u2014studying, when I saw her walk in with him right behind her. I was shocked because he never told me she was coming over. He had gone to the gym that morning, and during those hours I had called and texted him out of concern because he\u2019s never spent four hours at the gym.\n\nAnn was as peppy as ever. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m an introvert with few friends, but I instantly felt uncomfortable. I did something I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014I went through his phone. I saw the messages and instantly felt numb. I confronted him and asked for an explanation. He said it was an innocent conversation and that\u2019s just how their friendship is.\n\nI asked him to imagine if a guy sent me those same messages. I reminded him that I\u2019ve told him twice now how uncomfortable I am with that friendship. His apology felt insincere, like he was refusing to take responsibility for his actions. He just laid in the bed, and I wanted to scream. I wanted him to feel the hurt I was feeling. Instead, I just left the room and cried. My emotions were so intense, I started pulling at my hair\u2014I had no one to talk to, and I felt like I was suffocating.\n\nEventually, I confided in his mother, and I felt a bit better. But now, he\u2019s ignoring me and remaim salute in his innocence.\n\nI also should mention he has never showed me any signs of cheating and besides those message.\n\nFootnote: Ann has a boyfriend. I told my boyfriend that he doesn\u2019t respect me\u2014or her boyfriend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When I say small it is literally just my boss and I, but where the office is we share a space with multiple other small businesses. With that being said, our parking lot is also pretty small as well and once it fills up, you have to park in a different lot that\u2019s a block or so from the building. We have two handicap spots in this lot that for a bit were hard to see bc the lines were faded to hell. Recently, the landlord had the lot repainted and so you can see, very clearly might I add, where the handicap parking is as well as the handicap loading/ unloading area between the two spots. Even before the lot was resurfaced, one of the businesses in this building would always park in the handicap spot or loading area. Even after the lot has now been repainted, they are continuing to park in those areas and my boss makes a comment to me about it every time he notices them parked there. They do not have a back tag that has the handicap sticker or a hanging thing from their mirror. I had asked if maybe he could get the landlord to say something to them, but my boss told me he\u2019s not a very confrontational person. I wrote up this note to stick on cars that do park there (there are a couple of ppl that will park there without the handicap sticker). I sent to my two best friends and they say it probably is a little petty, but I thought Reddit might be a little more honest as well.

She like to keep the house at 69, but because our AC works quite well it's usually even colder in the house\u2014even worse upstairs. I will definitely says that it's warmer downstairs... but it's not actually warm. It's just warmer compared to how FREEZING it is upstairs (I think the upstairs is colder because of it's much smaller size). As I'm writing this my fingers, nose, and feet are so cold that they're tingling and numb. I'm wearing long sleeves, fluffy socks, five blankets, and a comforter.\n\nFor obvious reasons, I went downstairs to turn the heat up. But my mom still claimed to be hot. Of course I don't want her to be uncomfortable either, but I literally can't feel the tips of my fingers, toes and nose. She suggested that I instead sleep downstairs on the couch.\n\nThe issue with this is not only the lack of privacy, but the fact that my parents stay up drinking and arguing on said couch all night. This disagreement somehow spiraled into her and her boyfriend arguing, now I feel like it's all my fault. I didn't want anything like this to happen, but I'm so cold it actually hurts.\n\nDid I overreact? (SS is the number of times she's called me within the past few minutes to say I'm overreacting, lying, and to offer me to sleep on the couch/on the office floor)\n\nUpdate: I have been downgraded from the couch to the office floor apparently, because my mother has claimed the couch for watching TV.",

        "Background": "Update: idk if this subreddit has updates and idk how updates work. Here's the original post:\nI (20F) have been really close to my friend V(18M). We have all of the same interests and we've been best friends for about a year. For some context, V is mentally ill. idk all the problems he has but he takes medication for it, I think his family is against therapy. He has kleptomania, which he's struggled with since he was 8. He's unemployed so it's not like he could pay for it himself either. V's family is also extremely poor, they live off of footstamps and don't even have a functional shower. My family is pretty well off. Whenever we hung out, I bought him lunch and snacks. My grandma (65F) even gave him my grandpa's phone (he died recently so it wasn't in use) so that he could work on getting a job. She even got him a new phone case and a screen protector. She also gave them 1000 dollars worth of Walmart gift cards so his family could afford groceries. We've been nothing but nice to them...\n\nRecently, my grandma got alerted someone was using her credit card. I asked my friend if it was him because it looked like purchases he would like, and he said it was an accident. I told him to remove my grandma's credit card from his phone and he said he did. I asked him about it multiple times to be sure. Then, it all came crashing down yesterday.\n\nMy grandma noticed some purchases on her account for over 800 dollars. She told me V admitted to it. I told V I couldn't be friends with someone who blatantly stole money from my grandmother and especially someone who lied about it to my face multiple times. \n\nI was called by his mother who asked me to please consider. For some more added context, V was homeschooled at the end of his school life so he never really had any friends irl. It got even worse once his dad went to prison (he's been there for almost 6 years). His mom is depressed and never wants to go anywhere or do anything. She told me she deals with this all the time and understands why I'm upset, but she was just overjoyed that her son finally had a friend around his age that he could hang out with. She told me about how he attempted before. \n\nI'm trying to stand my ground and not fall for more sympathy... it's just hard when I think about how I was one of the only good things in his life. I'm just worried that since he only admitted to it when he was caught that he would have kept doing it... how long would my grandma keep losing money? How am I ever supposed to trust him again? The worse part is idek how he got access to my grandma's credit card. It makes me sick he took advantage of the sweetest most charitable woman ik. She's not even mad at him anymore because of his situation. All of the stuff he bought is going to my house... I'm kinda tempted to sell it instead of giving it to him. He shouldn't be rewarded for breaking my heart and trust. So, AIO for wanting to cut him off and never see him again?",

        "Background": "Hey guys, I hope you can give me some insight and open my eyes if needed. I apologize if this is the wrong sub to post this. \n\nI F27 have been with my boyfriend M28 for four years. \nFor the first 3,5 years, I had no reason to doubt anything about him at all, untill he moved to France for an internship.\n\nWell\u2026 Today I found this screenshot on my boyfriends phone. This message was sent to him by a female coworker. First one is the Google Translate version and the second one the original in French. \n\nMy boyfriend says that him and her got into multiple fights recently because he stopped taking shit from her and he says that thats the topic of this message. \nCould any French speakers tell me how this message sounds? Because this sure as hell doesnt seem to be about a friendship, but a romance. \n\n\nBackstory:\n\nHe is an Algerian working in France there and most of his coworkers are as well so they all became friends quickly. There is this one girl that for some reason, made me feel uncomfortable and suspicious from the start. \n\nAs my boyfriend told me, she is very clingy with the whole friend group. Always wants to meet and gets very mad when anyone meets without her. According to my boyfriend, she is a very difficult person and the whole friend group tries to avoid her. She doesnt understand boundaries and thats what made me suspicious for the first time. \n\nWhen he came to visit back in November, she would call him so many times. He always said that she has questions and problems about work because she has little work experience and cant work independently. What really ticked me off, is that she doesnt just call once and then leaves it. If he doesnt answer, she just calls five more times. She would call at any hour of the day, which striked me as extremely unprofessional.\n\nI asked him to set boundaries and distance himself, because I had a weird feeling about this girl and definitely saw her as potential danger. He agreed. \n\nHe always told me how there is nothing between them and that he cant stand her personality. But this message right here is so incredibly intense\u2026 I think I must be absolutely dumb if I decide to believe his version. \n\nWhat do you think? ",

It's like you're begging to go out and be taken advantage of Ok so by your logic since I'm not interested in your and you're a guy I should assume you have bad intentions too?

I don't think it's any of your business even if [redacted] is into me and if this was a date Oh so it is a date? I'm not sure if that's ok Good thing it's none of your business It's really weird for a guy I'm not even dating to be acting like this\"}]}"

He wanted to shake hands which I didn't think much off. He put one hand in mine and covered the other side of my hand ( trapping it inside ) he then with his middle finger massaged the inside of my palm while intensively looking in my eyes.\n\nI separate myself from the situation, but when I'm cleaning and he's sitting in front of the tv where we fold. He keeps looking at me following where I'm going ( still sitting ) in a way calling me over. I distance myself again and move to the office.\n\nI really don't feel safe at this point, he moves spots to the chairs by the bathrooms and keeps smiling at me. And repeating actions.  I completely avoid where he is, and try to \u201c hide myself \u201c. Next thing I know he's coming with his underwear out in the front, the pants are  almost at his knees. He's smirking at me still trying to keep eye contact.  Coworker comes he drops the smile. BUT SHE DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING. In fact she low-key gives him a flirty smile and pushes down on the pants with her fingers. Then the moment she goes to either the bathroom or I don't know.  He keeps asking for a handshake, I personally didn't want to believe anything wrong was going on. I was trying to convince myself I was delusional. I give him the handshake, he does it again this time more aggressive. ( middle finger, now we have two fingers) He has my hand the third time, keeps obsessing about me calling his name.  I can see he's getting frustrated I'm not giving to his attempt.  He tries for the. Forth time at which I loudly / firmly say no and move to the back of the office. I didn't want to make a scene.\n\nShe comes to me since earlier I told her she can leave early. Since I wanted the dude gone!( at that moment I didn't say anything about him.)\n\nAnd I straight up ask her if he was drunk. She gets confused says no and asks if he did anything weird and since I was already scared at that point and freaked out all I could do is nodd my head. She asks him what he did and then moved to him. I didn't see or hear that part. But they were very quick, they leave. I have past trauma and I have been assaulted before and I'm freaking out. When I come home I text her and she promises to never bring him back again. ( she dismisses what he did )\n\nNext time I have a shift with her ( shift transfer and that's usually 5-10 minutes unless we have drops. And I'm usually always alone.)  that time since I was scared I asked another girl to be with me. And when she saw the other girl she kept on texting me, and she waited like 20-30 minutes even though it wasn't busy. When I come and saw he was there, he looked at me but before anything I went into our office angry as hell. I went there because I saw the other girl so I hugged her and clocked in. I'm a big hugger and effection shower, I'm always there for everyone. And most people prefer coming to me for issues instead of the manager.  She comes in the office all happy and shit, I can tell she wants to hug me and bla bla bla. I don't do it I move to the storage which is across the room basically the furthest part of the whole store. I avoid and ignore her.  After that like 10-15 minutes she texts me this.\n\n\nAnd I don't know what to do. I want to rip her hair out.\n\nAnd also, during the whole shift before her husband come in.  She kept trying to teach me how to ask someone to f me in Spanish and similar words. And even before including today she kept going on about how good he is in bed. Completely unprovoked and with me never mentioning anything sexual to her! I think I cussed 3 times in front of her, she's been there 4 months.\n\nAnd also in some of the ss its kinda implicated I'm late and bla bla bla. Never been late before, I usually come 1 h before my shift to help out. Always. But last time she worked I come exactly at 8:00. And that's my clock in",

Think horseback riding and country clubs... divorced with grown children) I never would have wanted anything to do with him. \nFor this story, let's call her Fefe. \n\nOk, so his timeline is he met Fefe 8+ years ago. Like a year and a half in, got in a serious relationship with a different woman for 2 years. We will call her Nelly, while he continued to sleep with Fefe. \n\nHe never took Fefe on dates, he made fefe park her car around the corner from his house. \nHe had some weird __x stuff with Fefe, and maintained this relationship with Nelly, insisting he was not physically attracted to Nelly....all the while fucking Fefe on the side. \n\nHe said he wanted to end his relationship with Nelly, but didn't know how, so he was trying to get caught cheating.\nFefe sent dirty photos and videos of this man cheating to Nelly!\nI am assuming that he denied it, said the videos were old? Either way eventually Nelly showed up at Fefe's home while he was there in the morning.\n\nFast forward to May 2025. This man and I start talking, and it was not a really great relationship. \nSexually we are compatible, and it could have been very good relationship if he had been emotionally available....\n\nI felt him being emotionally unavailable and I went on the \ud83e\uded6 and found Fefe. She blocked me on Facebook, I googled her phone number, and called her. We spoke for 1.5 hours. \n\nFefe said they were together in April of 2025 the last time, physically. She never admitted to fucking him while he and I were together, but I know she did. She shared sexual text messages between the two of them. He was telling her he was not seeing anyone over and over when he was seeing me. He told her repeatedly he missed her, reaching out to her. \nWhen confronted he said he didn't do anything wrong, swore he didn't cheat, and he didn't feel bad for the texts. \nJust the way he spoke about this woman made me sick. No respect for her at all. \nI dumped him. \nEven without the cheating, he was cheap, lazy, deceitful, dishonest, judgemental, racist, homophobic, uncultured, selfish, greedy, and lacking a backbone and a proper chin. \n\nWhatever, I saw him one last time in the beginning of September, now I am pregnant.\n\n\nBefore I knew for sure I was pregnant, I asked him to dinner, my treat. My only stipulation was that he message this woman requesting her to never contact him again, and block her. \n\nHe called me crazy, he said I was obsessed with her and childish. He said he would not do that. \nHe says he's not in contact with her now. \n\nAm I the asshole for requesting this man tell this woman to not contact him again and block her in order to give me peace of mind? \n\nIs this really such a irrational ridiculous request?

He has like 20 Gmail accounts and low and behold I find an email from some girl. The last 1 is from this morning!!!! Nothing inappropriate was being talked about. But the email in and of itself is inappropriate.  I confront him, he denies it. Trying to tell me he shares this account with a friend and it must be him talking to this girl.

        "Background": "As the title reads, my dearest MIL stealthily canceled our honeymoon hotel reservation. For those of you who don\u2019t know, I posted on Reddit a few days ago about how my MIL and SIL went behind our backs and invited their friends to our wedding after we explicitly said no. This incident happened about a week ago and just a few days after that, my MIL lied to the hotel reception, faking a phone call to cancel our honeymoon suite booking.\n\nShe and my FIL were visiting Chicago (where we live) for 10 days to see their son. My fiance mostly stayed home during their visit to make the most of their time together. A few days ago, after breakfast, MIL asked to borrow his phone for an urgent call to her church, claiming her network was out of range. Nothing about it seemed off so obviously he handed it over. Our best guess is that\u2019s when she called the hotel, pretending to be me and told them we had to cancel because we were postponing our trip. Since the call went from my fiance\u2019s number and she claimed to be me, the hotel had no reason to question it. The cancellation went through on 03/28 and they even sent a confirmation email to his email (which was used at the time of booking).\n\nWe\u2019ve been super caught up in the thick of our wedding preparation, so he hasn\u2019t been getting time lately to actively check his emails everyday. This morning, while looking through his inbox for a vendor detail, this cancellation mail caught him off guard. For the first half n hour, we were absolutely dumbfounded with 1000 questions on our mind. When we called the reception to check, they informed us everything that I mentioned above. They said that I (who apparently called them), even told them the reservation number and check in dates for final verification. It was a very straight answer, it\u2019s MIL, because there has been no one over at our place in the past 10 days who could\u2019ve pretended ro be \u201cme\u201d and pulled this off. My SIL and her 6 y/o kid are staying with us because of her marriage issues (that\u2019s a whole other drama), but she\u2019s been at her friend\u2019s place for five days now.\n\nWhen we planned our honeymoon last year, my FIL was the one who suggested this very hotel so MIL obviously knew about it. But we kept on wondering how the hell did she get the reservation details the reception asked for. After this, Nathaniel (my fiance) rang her thrice but she didn\u2019t answer so I texted her. She responded like a weirdo she is (as you can see in the screenshots) and my last message didn\u2019t even get delivered in blue. Three hours later, she finally called us when both of us raised hell on her. She tried red herring us with her BS, but after realising we are on the verge of disinviting her from the wedding, she finally accepeted what she did. When we asked her about the reservation details, she said she got it from Nate\u2019s email when he gave her his phone unlocked for making the call. The fake fucking story she tried to sell us was that she wanted to surprise us with a honeymoon suite at an even better hotel, as a wedding gift. Ofc none of us bought that nonsense and Nate counter questioned her for details of this supposed new hotel. \n\nShe started fumbling, spat out the name of some godforsaken random ass hotel in Rome and dodged the call saying she\u2019s babysitting our nephew at the moment. We just called the rando hotel which is our \u201cwedding present\u201d you guys, and why am I not surprised there\u2019s no fucking room booked under either of our names, let alone suite. We tried booking ourselves again at hotel \u2018X\u2019 which we originally booked and our suite\u2019s already gone to the person next in queue. We tried settling for other rooms but they said May\u2019s the peak season in Europe, so they can\u2019t accomodate us at the moment and will notify if something opens up later.

        "Background": "CONTEXT (sorry it\u2019s long I tried to break it up):\nI was a healthy kid for the majority of my childhood, bar several ear infections as a baby and then chronic tonsillitis as I got older. I ended up having my tonsils taken out as an adult in the US, since the wait had been so long in the UK when I was a kid it never happened. Besides those things, I was athletic, active, and happy. \n\nIn my early teens I was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, which caused hormonal fluctuations, anxiety, depression, weight gain, and other painful symptoms. I became less active because I was depressed and began to struggle considerably with my mental health, which led to struggles with eating disorders, self-harm, and suicidal ideation. \n\nAs I got older, my health got shittier. I went through ups and downs with my mental health but my physical health was on a slight but steady decline. In 2016, I was diagnosed with a herniated disc which led to pain for the better part of a decade and eventually permanent damage. In 2019, I had a seizure while driving and was in a serious car accident. I had a severe concussion and was dealing with the after effects of the seizure as well, so recovery was slow. I started to get better and then Covid hit. I managed to avoid Covid for a while but when I finally got it, it hit HARD. A few months after that, I got the flu and had a fever of 104\u00b0 for multiple days. \n\nAfter that I was just always sick, always exhausted, always in pain. Last year, Feb 2024, I finally had surgery on my spine and the surgeon discovered that the disc I was assured would heal on its own had calcified, complicating the surgery and the recovery. It sucked but I was happy I had the surgery and did my best to power through. I returned to work too soon and became overwhelmed and in the late summer of 2024 I was hospitalised for a nervous breakdown because I was on the verge of suicide. I worked hard on myself and my mental health and got better, returned to work, found a better balance in my life. \n\nMy physical health continued to decline, but now at a more rapid rate - bringing us to now. I have gone from being a somewhat healthy 29 year old with fatigue and joint pain to being wheelchair bound, experiencing a plethora of life-altering symptoms, and I am being tested for a wide variety of autoimmune conditions. My doctor believes it may be MS, and that whatever it was may have been there for a while but was triggered by the stress of last year. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell many people this was happening because I know my health issues are a lot and I was worried people would say I was being dramatic (god, do I wish). I finally told my sisters today about what\u2019s been going on, as matter-of-factly as I could, and this is what one of them responded. My family is British and repressed and we power through our issues without bothering each other so the fact that I share anything bad about my health or life is already abnormal, but to receive this kind of message has devastated me. My sister has always responded to me like I\u2019m a dramatic child (she\u2019s 13 years older than me) and her suggestion for dealing with most things is just to get over it, but this is on a new level. \n\nI am terrified about what\u2019s going on with my body, I\u2019m scared I\u2019m dying, my parents are scared, I\u2019m barely a functional person anymore. I just wanted to share what\u2019s happening in my life and maybe, HEAVEN FORBID, receive some emotional support (VIA TEXT!!! NOT EVEN A PHONE CALL!!!) but apparently that\u2019s burdening her because I\u2019m making it all up. \n\nAm I overreacting by wanting to go no-contact with my sister?  \n\n",

        "Background": "Hi Reddit. So a quick summary of what happened before this, in short detail. \n\nAs we were coming off of the tail of previous tension and making up, I told my girlfriend that I had two hard boundaries: that I am very uncomfortable with my partner bringing their friends into our relationship details in the middle of our arguments, and that I am very uncomfortable with the idea of another man sending money/buying things for my partner. To me, these things are very reasonable to ask of a partner and I believed she was on board with this prior, as I have asked these things of her before and she\u2019s respected them up to now. \n\nThough this time, she told me that she wasn\u2019t sure she agreed with these boundaries and needed to think about it. I told her that these were very important to me, and I was not comfortable continuing things if she could not respect me at the most basic level. She offered to sleep in the other room and I agreed it was for the best right now to give us space to think. \n\nFast forward a couple of days, I wake up to her sheepishly asking to lay in bed with me. She tells me she\u2019s been feeling sick, most likely because she had a day of missed antidepressants, lack of food and an unexpected reaction with other recent medication. Though after acting nice to me, she asks me directly if I could take her back up to McDonald\u2019s to get her a cheeseburger and a sweet tea. She had me do this the day prior, and I drove her up to use her points because I wanted her to feel better and I love her regardless if we were fighting or not. But lately my finances have been increasingly strained, as I have been supporting us both entirely with bills, medication, food, transportation and fun things for us to share. She has been staying at my house for 8 months unemployed smoking weed while I have been providing and looking out for her every need. \n\nIn response to her asking me for more McDonald\u2019s, I shared that finances are extremely low for me right now and that I would feel more comfortable if she\u2019d try to use her points again or make something at home instead. But she told me the only thing she is craving is a cheeseburger and sweet tea, and cannot eat anything else without getting sick from her medication-induced nausea. She then directly asked me if a friend, let\u2019s call him A, could cover her meal with his points instead. The previous tension we had been working through revolved around A, so I told her that I do not feel comfortable with that and that it could be something to discuss at a later time. She then sits silently for a moment without responding. \n\nSome quick backstory about A: he\u2019s a married man who has been constantly offering to cover various things for my girlfriend, such as offering to buy any desk she chooses on Amazon no questions asked. Before that, this man had blocked her on Discord because he had trash talked his wife to my girlfriend in her DM, so we assume his wife made him block her for two years. It wasn\u2019t until recently that he randomly unblocked her and began talking to her throughout the day, even into the early mornings between 2-6am while I\u2019m sleeping. There was even a point she was speaking to him daily much more than me for a few weeks straight. I voiced my discomfort with him constantly wanting to send her money and how much attention she gives another man while ignoring her boyfriend. I thought that she set this boundary with him and agreed to respect our relationship. \n\nSo flash forward to now. My girlfriend then tells me she\u2019ll start \u201clooking through her accounts to see if she has any money laying around,\u201d then goes to the bathroom with her phone. When she returns, she has this story lined up about how she \u201cfound $5 randomly on Robinhood and transferred it immediately to her PayPal\u201d. This didn\u2019t add up to me, since I know there is no direct transfer from Robinhood to PayPal. I mention this in passing, and she stutters a bit uncomfortably and drops it. The drive to McDonald\u2019s was very awkward and quiet, and I figured something was up. \n\nBefore we got home, I directly asked my girlfriend if she would ever lie to me about small things like this. She then immediately confessed to lying to my face, as her friend had indeed covered the meal and she used the funds left over from his previous PayPal sends to fund the sweet tea. Notice how I said \u201cprevious sends\u201d, because she later informed me that he had been sending her money for various things for at least a couple of weeks before this. All without my knowledge or comfort even being considered. She even had the audacity to say that me not getting her the McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger and tea was showing her I \u201cdidn\u2019t care about what she was going through\u201d and that she was \u201csuffering\u201d because of it, and that\u2019s why it was ok to lie to me about her friend sending her money without my knowledge. She says it was out of necessity, but as she admitted before, he had been sending her money for other things weeks before. She refuses to tell me what exactly he was buying her, which I feel tells me all I need to know. \n\nAfter hearing this I honestly felt hurt and betrayed. Like I was disposable because I was uncomfortable giving my girlfriend money I did not have at the time. So I simply told her I would no longer be providing anything for her and locked myself in my room. We had a blowout of yelling between us for a few minutes shortly after, which I honestly do regret and have since apologized for. But the above screenshots are from my (ex?) girlfriend regarding the situation, saying that I am not experienced enough to know that my expectations are irrational. I do agree that I should find someone who respects these boundaries, but I feel that these are rather tame requests I had for her and it\u2019s shocking that she couldn\u2019t care about me at a basic level to agree to them.\n\nI love my (ex?) girlfriend and it pains me that she betrayed my trust like this, even over something as stupid as a cheeseburger. But I genuinely worry that if she was okay with lying to me over something so small, then what would she be okay with lying to me about in the future if I stay with her? \n\nTLDR: Is it really that uncommon for boyfriends to ask their girlfriends not to have their guy friends spoil them with money or goods, and to avoid trash talking their boyfriends to their friends (especially other men)? Or are these things rather common requests between partners? \n\nP.S.: I\u2019d also like to add that I think sending friends gifts on holidays, special occasions, birthdays, or normal types of friendly gestures is perfectly normal and I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with that. I just find constantly offering to send money, lying about receiving money for at least two weeks from a married man behind my back, and telling him all of our relationship conflict details and bad talking me is not acceptable.

        "Background": "I\u2019m 21F & have been sitting on this for a while now. Don\u2019t know how to feel, made this account just to get it out and get some perspective. Fake names used so that things make sense. Sorry this is **very** long, please read it if you can.\n\n**TL;DR:** 17M brother has been telling his friendship group that I\u2019m a drug addicted homeless bum for 3 years (ever since I left home for uni). These are people who knew me back when I lived at home. His friendship group found out the web of lies he created & cut him off. I haven\u2019t confronted him yet. I feel violated but don\u2019t know what to make of my feelings and what next steps to take as our parents enable him fully & so would likely minimise everything. \n\nNearly 2 weeks ago, a friend (Elias 21M) I hadn\u2019t spoken to in a few years sent me this message. For context we were quite close, on the brink of starting something romantic before I moved away for uni. The distance and busy life made us lose contact - I always hoped for a reconnection but I never imagined it would come like this, 3 years down the line. His younger brother (Adam) is in a friendship group with my younger brother (Zac). They\u2019re both 17M.\n\nWe called that night, and Elias said that as Adam took his phone & looked through my TikTok (I post regularly on there) he was confused seeing me look \u201cnormal, healthy and living my life at uni\u201d. When he searched up my username on his own phone he saw that he had me blocked when he cannot remember ever doing that. Adam then told Elias that for around 3 years now, Zac has been telling all his boys stuff about his \u201cdrug-addicted bum loser of a sister\u201d. Things like \u201cshe\u2019s unstable, making the home unsafe\u201d. Then as soon as I moved out for uni it changed to: \u201cShe flopped her exams and couldn\u2019t go uni then had a mental breakdown and turned to drugs to cope so now she\u2019s a homeless nitty.\u201d (Nitty means crackhead, UK slang). Crazy false shit like that.\n\nAdam said it wasn\u2019t an everyday occurrence so it didn\u2019t raise any red flags. All his friends just thought it was Zac sometimes venting about an unfortunate family situation. Since this was over many years, it just seemed like the truth to them. The lies began roughly around the time I was moving out for university (when I was 18 and Zac was 14). I haven\u2019t been home much since then either since I don\u2019t have close friends there and have been busy, which probably kept up the facade of the lies.\n\nAdam jumped on the call and further elaborated on what was said over the years, how I was painted as a bottom barrel scum human. He said as soon as he saw my tiktok he made a group chat with the other boys (excluding Zac) and asked them to search me up - all of them had me blocked. They concluded that Zac somehow managed to block me from all of his friends\u2019 accounts without raising suspicion. The last 2 screenshots are from January 2024, when Zac sent me a message telling me to block 2 of his friends because they were \u201cstalking my account\u201d and being \u201cweirdos\u201d. I genuinely thought he was looking out for me so I blocked them. Come to find out those boys were not as close to Zac so he couldn\u2019t access their phone in any capacity, and that\u2019s why he told me to block them. He never wanted them to come across my social media and clock the web of bullshit that he had so carefully weaved.\n\nI asked Adam why he never questioned it/ asked his brother (Elias) about it since he knows we used to be friends and that could\u2019ve  given him more information. Adam said that Zac always framed it like a shameful secret that was burdening him and didn\u2019t want spread like gossip, so they honoured \u201cbro-code\u201d and didn\u2019t talk about it unless Zac brought it up.  \n\nI feel sick. As he grew up he started being a little shit and extra disrespectful but I didn\u2019t expect the vitriol to run this deep. I need to emphasise that I\u2019ve **NEVER** done anything bad to him - in fact I used play games with him and entertain him growing up, bought him things, covered for him etc. like I was so chill. My parents\u2019 lenience towards him **NEVER** affected my ability to be a good loving sister. Then he hit adolescence and changed but I thought that was normal teenage boy things. Obviously not. The guy clearly hates my guts.\n\nI don\u2019t live there anymore, I don\u2019t see him often, but I still feel so violated that all this time there were crazy lies floating around that people actually believed. People that *knew* me - and now that\u2019s the crazy image of me he has curated to them. \n\nThe call with Elias ended on a \u201cI\u2019ll call you back I need to process this\u201d note but it\u2019s been basically 2 weeks and I haven\u2019t done anything. Just been losing my mind over this shit in private. Elias left me a voicemail today saying that Adam couldn\u2019t keep quiet and confronted Zac in school with his friends. They apparently cut him off, I don\u2019t know the details.\n\nI haven\u2019t called Zac (immediately blocked him after what I heard) or my parents. They enable him so I don\u2019t trust that they\u2019ll see the seriousness of this. Actually I\u2019m 99% sure they\u2019ll minimise it and tell me I\u2019m too grown to worry about teenage boy talk. I don\u2019t even trust myself with how I\u2019m feeling, I\u2019m circling between baffled, hurt and disgusted. I think even a little scared.\n\nIdk if I should gather more info, confront this so-called brother or just ignore it since his friends have already confronted him. I really feel like blasting his stupid ass on that very same TikTok he tried to block people from seeing, but that feels like an unnecessary overreaction. I\u2019ve been massively overthinking this and it\u2019s affected my daily life. I haven\u2019t slept a wink these past couple of days. Just mulling over this. Idk how to approach it and I feel so damn sick. \n\nLogically, I know speaking to Zac to figure out why he did this would be the next step but I haven\u2019t been able to do that yet, I\u2019m not ready to hear his voice rn. Idk what the right reaction here is, a part of me feels like it\u2019s not worth talking about since the lies were contained to his friends only & they\u2019ve dealt with it. But a bigger part of me knows I have to speak up since it\u2019s lies about me. I just feel nauseous thinking about how to do it. Why did my brother do this? Am I overreacting, is this bigger and deeper in my head than it is in reality? My mind is extremely frazzled, sorry if this post is just rambling on. I would appreciate any thoughts or advice or anything. \n\n\n",

In the year we were together, he referred to her as his \u201cwife\u201d present tense 4 times. And once after sex talked about her.\n\nWe had a long conversation where he admitted to texting his ex and that female 3 was an ex as well. I\u2019m another conversation he told me that female 2 and him slept in the same bed at their annual gaming weekend when they both were married. Neither of them told their spouses at the time. \n\nWhen he went to gaming weekend the following weekend with female 2, and did not text / call for 24 hours it was very disrespectful since we had just talked about communication. \n\nSo, when we went on our international trip and I found a note in his pocket from his friend (female 2), it sent me. The very distinctive heart shape, made me remember that he had put up her Valentine note on his refrigerator but left the card that I got him at my house. \n\nFemale 2 has been a thorn in his marriage and with his ex girlfriend. So on the trip I told him that he cannot control what she does but he can control how he reacts. \n\nFast forward to when we got back, because of logistics, he had to go over to female 2\u2019s house to pick up my cat before picking me up from the airport. And he was 30 minutes late (after 3 days of travel) because female 2 \u201cjust wouldn\u2019t stop talking, you know how she is\u201d. \n\nSo after he mentioned her name 8 times on the car ride home, I decided that it wasn\u2019t worth my time having more conversations. The next time I saw him, I told him that we don\u2019t communicate well and communication is everything in a relationship. \n\nAfter the break up, we did have a half marathon scheduled and we ended up running it together so we did a bit of talking. \n\nHe mentioned that female 2\u2019s boyfriend moved in officially, but they seem to still be having trouble. I said, \u2018of course they are - when she\u2019s pouring her attention and energy into all of her friends and using them for emotional support, what does it leave for him. Just sex & that gets old quickly.\u2019 \n\nAnd when thinking about our relationship, I felt like the only thing I brought to the table that he didn\u2019t get elsewhere was sex. \n\nI miss my ex as a person, and he was so kind and supportive in so many ways, but I don\u2019t think trust can be rebuilt because he doesn\u2019t have any boundaries when it comes to the opposite sex. And still doesn\u2019t see how hurtful it was to have been giving attention to all these women while we were together. \n\nThere\u2019s physical cheating and there is emotional cheating, and emotional cheating can be just as damaging. What lingers in my head is that \u2026 This is what I caught him on, so what do I not know? \n\nAt the same time, I miss him. Why do I hate that I\u2019m questioning myself for breaking things off and also that a part of me wants him back?\n\nAIO or is bringing in 4 women into our relationship a deal breaker?\n\n\n",

        "Background": "I am sure there\u2019s gonna be tons of context I am missing, please feel free to ask questions on anything I have left too vague. \n\n\nBasically, I (31 F) cut off my entire friend group with little/no explanation. Most of these friendships lasted longer than 15+ years. I made genuinely wonderful memories with these people and considered most of them to be like family. But after a significant period of time where something did not feel right, I followed this gut instinct telling me to just walk away. I had an intense feeling like I was not wanted around anymore. I questioned it a few times but was always brushed off or told I was overreacting. \n\nOn top of the unspoken tension, there was a huge disagreement one day between myself and two other women in the group. It was two against one, and I was outnumbered in the argument. I still feel I was speaking the truth and they were being unfair towards me\u2026.\n\nHowever, the subject of this argument is extremely sensitive and I feel I was quickly painted as the bad guy amongst the group. After this argument, I was ostracized further. Those that weren\u2019t even apart of the disagreement had clearly started to take sides. I blocked all of them on social media in March. I have not heard from any of them since. This makes me feel I made the right decision to end these friendships and I am confident it was time.\n\n\nMy biggest concern is I overreacted in the initial argument that started this all. Maybe I have some reflecting to do? I accused someone in the group of lying/exaggerating they had a heart attack. But I do truly believe she is at least exaggerating. I will call her \u201cAbbey\u201d for this post. \u201cMegan\u201d is the friend in the screenshots. Back when Abbey is claiming she had her heart attack, she had been just diagnosed with herpes a couple weeks prior. I only mention this because apparently there\u2019s a correlation between heart spasms and the first flair up of herpes your body has to fight. At the time, we even mentioned that might\u2019ve been the cause. \n\nShe drove herself to the hospital for chest pain and was admitted and released after 24 hours. She said it was a heart spasm and even posted it on Instagram\u2026.but months later, while chatting with strangers at a bar, the story changed. My ears were especially on high alert to hearing this because 5 years ago, my Dad died suddenly of a heart attack in my arms. I don\u2019t take her throwing that around lightly.\n\n\nI am so hurt that my friendships ended this way, but I feel I am better off at the end of the day. My only concern is my behavior was way off and if I did something wrong I want to be aware and do better. Did I overreact due to trauma and feeling pushed away by the group? Does Abbey\u2019s story changing seem strange to anyone else? \n\nHere\u2019s some screenshots of the original conversations between Megan and I where she stuck up for Abbey and we argued about it. There\u2019s also an image of the post Abbey made about the \u201cheart attack\u201d (The medical records she apparently sent to Megan to prove it was a heart attack I might have somewhere in my photos. I will add it if I find it.)",

        "Background": "\nI want to preface this by saying I usually never celebrate my birthday, but I was turning 21 so I wanted to do something simple like going out to dinner. Me and my 3 friends had a group chat together. I texted in the gc about three weeks prior to my birthday saying something along the lines of \u201chey if I have a birthday dinner, will you guys come?\u201d Only asked because they have a past of being flakey or cancelling plans. So of course they all said yes. I couldn\u2019t make the reservation until about a week before my birthday since the restaurant said it was too early. When I did make the reservation, I sent in the gc shortly after. Everyone agreed to the time and that was that. The restaurant was a little ways from my hometown that I had recently moved from. My birthday fell on a Sunday sadly, I drove down to stay with my mom for the weekend. Me and my friends had planed to hang out the Saturday before my birthday, since Monday everyone had work and we couldn\u2019t stay out too late. So, whatever Saturday comes around, we all hang out, I stayed until 12 so yk happy birthday me and then I left shortly after. Got back around 12:30, woke up at 8 the next day. I went out to breakfast and ran errands and was tired since I slept late and woke up early, so I took a nap before it was time to get ready. Almost nothing was said in the gc all morning besides feeling hungover. It was around 3 when I took a nap and woke up at 5. Friend A texts in the gc asking when to get ready at around 3:30. Ofc I didn\u2019t see this because I was asleep so I respond at 5 when I woke up, that I was about to get ready. Friend A now texts and says she\u2019s going to the hospital because her hangover has been so bad since 8am. If you were feeling sick all day, why would you wait until an hour before we\u2019re supposed to go out? Friend B lives in the same area as me about 30 minutes from our hometown. I\u2019m including screenshots just to save myself from paraphrasing each text, but she basically said I answered too late and she was already dropping off her brother. I\u2019m confused as to what that means. So I ask her if she\u2019s still coming and she says probably not because she didn\u2019t get ready. Why do I need to tell you when to be ready? You knew the reservation was at 6:30. At this point I\u2019m pissed and Friend C isn\u2019t answering at all. I called three times and no answer. Friend B then texts me outside of the gc to ask if I\u2019m upset. Like of course I am! It\u2019s my birthday and you guys all just cancelled on me with some dumb excuses. I took the night to sleep on it and I removed them off everything. I had a feeling they\u2019d do this, but I really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt because why would my friends do that to me on my birthday. But they couldn\u2019t even prove me wrong.",

Last year (when I was in 11th) I was the editor and helped with script writing, and the movie turned out to place 2nd in the competition. This year I was unable to participate since juniors filled up the positions before I had the chance to register. They didn't have an editor, our teacher knew I was good at editing and hence assigned me as the editor even though I'm not an official participant.\n\nI would not have been getting any certificate or any sort of official recognition. Basically doing this for free. Then I get the above text messages from the group leader. First voice message from her is about how she wants me to \"remove shadows from the video, change certain dresses from a patterned design to a plain white design, make the audio clearer, etc.\"\n\n*I am 17.* I only have basic experience with Adobe premiere pro and am fully self taught. I'm very proud of the skill level I have because I do great if I have a certain vision, but literally everything she listed seems way above 'basic skills' like she keeps saying. Second voice message was me explaining I can do basic editing like mashing together clips, adding bg audio, adding subtitles, help with figuring out even the pacing or the narrative if she's willing to let me help because that last part is exactly what I excel in.\n\nI informed my class teacher of everything the next day but she instead turned to me and called me selfish for abandoning my team for a small thing as a certificate. She also went on about how she thought I was selfless and helpful but now my image is ruined in her eyes. I'm sorry but *what are you on about?* Since when was it mandatory for me to suck it up for the sake of a team that doesn't appreciate me???\n\nThere's just something so off about the tone this girl was texting me in and I'm genuinely very offended, because who said it was ok to talk to people like that? My teacher is saying that it's a small matter and I should take the high road and give them a hand. Womp womp bitch. I don't wanna. I have self respect.\n\nAlso worth mentioning they couldn't find anyone other than me who has editing experience other than one girl who's charging 2500 Rupees for the whole thing, and the best part is that she doesn't have any of the 'basic skills' that were supposedly compulsory. So now I'm expected to go back and work for free to get them off the hook. First up, the movie submission is in four days. They haven't shooted jack shit. Even if I do help them, I fully expect them to dump the videos on me all at once and expect me to edit together the whole movie in less than one night. \n\nApparently I'm being pissy and petty (according to my teacher) but I see it as teaching them a lesson. If you're gonna talk big why don't go ahead with it??? They're only one year younger than me and I'm not a saint, I don't see why I should excuse their behavior.",

        "Background": "This happened a while ago but it still deeply bothers me. I\u2019ve talked to a handful of my friends about it and there response is \u201cDude, you must be gay\u201d or \u201cyou lucky dog, what\u2019s the problem?!\u201d\n\nSo for context, my (now ex) girlfriend and I are both Law Enforcement for the same department. I work nights, she worked days so our schedules were kinda hectic sometimes. She came to my apartment one night and when I got home she put a boba tea in my hand and told me to drink it. I\u2019m not a fan of boba so I told her thank you, that was sweet, but I\u2019d rather have something else. She acted really disappointed and was being very adamant that I should drink it. I didn\u2019t want to make her feel bad since I thought she was just trying to do something nice for me so I took a few sips and set it down. She picked it up off the counter, put it back in my hand, and said \u201cyou need to drink all of it\u201d. I told her fine, we went to go lay down and watch a movie where I set the cup on my night stand and didn\u2019t touch it again. \n\nWe ended up having sex a few times and at some point I got up and went to my kitchen to grab a drink. When I opened my trash can to throw something away, I saw a medication blister pack sitting on top of the garbage. At first I didn\u2019t think anything of it, but then I remembered how adamant she was about me finishing that drink and everything started to click. I picked it up and sure enough, it was a Viagra packaging. I immediately got this overwhelming feeling of being violated. I didn\u2019t know what to say, and I was honestly pretty hurt. So, not wanting to let my immediate emotions lead me into saying something I would regret, I held my tongue and went to bed. \n\nThe next day she texted me saying I seemed off and I decided to confront her by asking about the drink. She initially denied it all but when I sent her a picture of the wrapper, she just responded with the \u201c\ud83d\ude18\u201d emoji, as if it was some cute romantic act. It turned into a huge argument because she just couldn\u2019t comprehend why this was bothering me so much, saying \u201cit\u2019s basically just vitamins\u201d and that she originally got the idea from an episode of Bobs Burgers. \n\nBut what finally sent me over the edge was the text above, where she thought that I was mad because I was \u201cemasculated\u201d and that her and her roommate (who is ALSO a police officer) came up with the whole plan while I was at work because I had told her how busy my day was and how I couldn\u2019t wait to just lay down. And since she was worried I\u2019d be too tired to have sex, her roommates boyfriend gave her the pill. \n\nI tried to further explain my point by trying to reverse it and explain that if I had done something similar to her and she reported it to PSU (Professional\nStandards, which is just another way of saying Internal Affairs), I would have been fired and most likely arrested. Her response was basically just saying \u201cwell I would never report it\u201d which I took as her beginning to get scared and trying to convince me not to. \n\nOur relationship ended soon after, when on a trip to Peru a \u201cdoctor\u201d used a guinea pig to absorb negative energy from her before sacrificing it to rid her of the negativity, and apparently the doctor told her the guinea pig said that I was a source of negativity in her life so she broke up with me. (I wish I was making this up, but that\u2019s a story for another post\u2026)\n\nAnyhow, Am I Overreacting for letting this turn into such a big problem or was she genuinely just trying to make a romantic gesture?",

It\u2019s passionate, I give them that.

        "Background": "Sorry for the long title lol. I\u2019m 17f, the oldest daughter of five. Two of my siblings are five (twins) and the other two are 16 and 14. \n\nFor some backstory, I\u2019ve been doing chores since I was like nine, maybe? I don\u2019t remember too clearly. My mom\u2019s always worked from home (if she ever worked at the time) but she wasn\u2019t very keen on house chores and often would go on about how her friends\u2019 kids clean the entire house regularly. I still don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case considering how young we were but oh well. She had my youngest siblings when I was 12 and assumed that since I can now go to school by myself and fix up something simple, I must be ready to take on all her responsibilities as a mom.\n\nI looked after both kids while she was going for postpartum and still continue to do so. She\u2019s eased up and has started taking them to kindergarten after numerous arguments. I primarily also do all the house chores, not because I want to but because if I don\u2019t, nobody else will. My younger sister (16) will sometimes do the dishes if I nag her enough but other than that, laundry, plants, bathing, feeding and taking the kids to their appointments all falls on me. I cannot tell you how many times I\u2019ve been mistaken for their mom at their kindergarten. It\u2019s EXTREMELY frustrating, high school is getting more difficult and stressful and I genuinely cannot find the time to study except in the middle of the night which just means losing sleep.\n\nMy parents are separated so sometimes I go to my dad\u2019s house to cool off for a few days. Guess the state the house is in when I come back\ud83d\ude10 now he\u2019s travelling and I\u2019m stuck here without a house to escape to for some peace. anyway, my teacher pulled me aside last week since I\u2019ve been dozing off all week and I just told her I wasn\u2019t getting a lot of sleep. I didn\u2019t tell her the full reason, just that it\u2019s a full house and I can only get proper studying done when everyone\u2019s asleep. She called my mom, concerned, and my mom got angry. When I came back home, the yelling match started about how I\u2019m trying to get CPS to take my siblings away by spreading nonsense at school and that according to her, her occasional cooking and taking HER children to their kindergarten is her doing everything while I simply help out occasionally by taking care of my laundry and cleaning after myself. Obviously, that made me mad. Maybe immaturely so because since then, I\u2019ve refused to lift a finger. I\u2019ll do my dishes, my laundry and keep my room clean but no more picking my siblings up, no waking them, no picking up after the older siblings or partaking in any chores. \n\nThe messages here are messages my sister sent me this morning while I was at school. We argued when I got home; she told me I\u2019m being immature and should be talking about sharing the chores rather than abandoning them as a whole because they can\u2019t keep up now. I didn\u2019t really care for a thing she said but now she\u2019s gone and called my dad and he\u2019s also upset with me for being problematic. ",

This family member still has their faculties, and I will be visiting with them and saying goodbyes, and I\u2019m really struggling to process this and everything. I\u2019ve never gone through anything like that before. I told my boyfriend who I\u2019ve been with for over 10 years and have a small business with.

I didn\u2019t go to sleep till 6 AM this morning, we both woke up at noon. \n  I had weird fever dreams, and didn\u2019t sleep well, so I just feel out of it. He got dressed for work, and then sat next to me, asking me what he should do, his way of asking if he should go to work, but it\u2019s not really a question, that\u2019s why he got dressed. I asked him not to seek validation from me right now. We both knew that he wanted to go to work, but felt bad about it, so he was like asking for permission from me. To be honest, I just didn\u2019t want to deal with it, I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, or think about it. \n  He went to work of course, and now, of course, I\u2019m thinking about it.

We\u2019ve been together for 3 years and have a large amount of mutual friends on Facebook. The city we live in has a close service industry and most people know each other. I\u2019ve worked at a handful of the most popular bars in the city and he goes out a lot. So It has never bothered me that we have a ton of mutual Facebook friends. My boyfriend also has a history of drunkenly cheating on me. (Something we have moved on from). But this situation seems weird to me? \ud83d\udea9\n\nWhat happened: When I see Facebook\u2019s \u201cpeople you may know know\u201d I always take a second to glance at it while scrolling. And this time a younger girl (21) popped up and our only mutual friends are my bf and one of his friends. I click on her page to discover she works at a local bar as well and I recognize her (she\u2019s served me before). My bf time to time goes to this bar. \n\nThe problem I have: Due to the lack of mutual friends I don\u2019t think this girl is on Facebook sending mass requests to people she\u2019s seen. So I have a feeling my boyfriend went out of his way to add her. He does not post on Facebook at all he\u2019s just a lurker (sorta important info). \n\nI\u2019ve been bartending for 8 years and I know when I was 21 I would\u2019ve accepted requests from bar regulars to help build a following. Looking back though I realize how creepy and not okay it was. \n\nAfter thinking about how this made me feel\u2026I feel it is unacceptable for a man with a girlfriend to add his bartender on social media. (Especially with this age gap). What do they have in common? What even is the purpose of adding her? \n\nI tried asking him for some clarity. Should I have approached this differently? I\u2019m sure. But with our history, I\u2019d like to just get straight to the point. Am I over reacting? Is this something that continues to be normal? Do you let your S/Os add whoever?

        "Background": "Hi guys. Around end of March my family and I went on a day trip to Europe, where at the end of it, there was a bit of a verbal altercation between myself (F 22) and my cousin (F 20). If you check out my profile you can see another post I made about her around a year ago.\n\nFor a bit of background information, my cousin\u2019s mum (F 50) works for an airline where she gets standby tickets and a list once a year that can be updated for family or friends to travel. I have been on this list for years now and don\u2019t really use it much, so this year when a swap was made to be fair to other people, I wasn\u2019t really bothered that my name was removed. My mum wanted us to travel together this year, but she also got over it pretty quickly and decided she\u2019d just go away on her own in the summer.\n\nHere\u2019s why this matters. On the journey back to the airport at the end of our day trip, my grandmother innocently suggested we go on another trip and make use of my aunt\u2019s standby tickets. It was a private conversation between myself and her, to which I replied \u201coh I\u2019m not on this year, but I don\u2019t have any plans to travel anyways. Maybe next year?\u201d. I purposely phrased it in a really lighthearted way because my aunt and uncle (both 37-40yrs) were standing behind me and they were the people who my name swapped with on the list. I didn\u2019t want it to sound like I was having a moan, because I wasn\u2019t, but wanted to be careful just in case how or what I said was taken out of context. As soon as I said this, my cousin shouted \u201cdon\u2019t lie\u201d. I was really taken aback because we were 1) on a packed train with tired people trying to get home from work and 2) I didn\u2019t get why she was so offended or trying to start something with me.\n\nI decided it wasn\u2019t the time or place so just left it until we got off of the train at the airport. I approached her very calmly and tried to reassure her that we weren\u2019t arguing and that I didn\u2019t mean to cause offence and wanted to know what it was that I said that provoked her to say that to me. She then accused me of \u201cbeing a liar and trying to slate her mother\u2019s reputation to our grandmother\u201d. I was really confused. After further prompting she then said she had no issue with the lie, but when I responded with \u201cwhat was the need to be so hostile then if you don\u2019t care\u201d she stomped her foot and got very verbally aggressive with me and stormed off. To clarify, the lie here to her is that I didn\u2019t just say I wanted to travel but couldn\u2019t. However, if you\u2019ll notice now, it would have been a lose-lose, as me saying that would\u2019ve fuelled her into thinking I\u2019m trying to stir stuff about her mum\u2019s intentions or that I\u2019m bitter towards aunt and uncle that are now on the list.\n\nAfter this she continued to try and start an argument where anytime I was speaking to another family member she would go \u201cI can hear you, you know!\u201d which then led to \u201cthis is why I don\u2019t like you, get your ugly face out of here\u201d. I found it really petty and then retorted with \u201cI think it\u2019s clear that I don\u2019t like you either but no matter what I try it\u2019s never the right option with you\u201d. I was really confused and angry as to how she had made such a mountain out of a molehill. We go through security and suddenly I hear a meltdown and see a crowd gathering around her. She\u2019s screaming, crying, borderline throwing up. My grandmother and I just watched in\u2026 awe? She then immediately got on the phone with her mother and berated me so I could hear her and continued to sob.\n\nWe got back home and the next day I just ignored her because I was tired of her behaviour. I was civil with her mother because she was okay with me too. I still hadn\u2019t told my mum what had happened because she wasn\u2019t on the trip either (both our mums weren\u2019t) and I figured that we\u2019re both adults so shouldn\u2019t need to get mothers involved. Next day her mum sends my mum a message about how I am a \u201cbully and abuser\u201d. And that I should learn to speak to her daughter more \u201cgently or not say anything at all. I\u2019ve attached screenshots of my interaction with her.\n\nAfter this, my aunt gets on the phone with my mum and says that \u201clet\u2019s be real if your daughter can\u2019t even maintain a relationship with her father, how can we expect her to maintain one with anyone?\u201d This was a really low blow considering I was raised in a DV household and have been to counselling because of my dad. She then went on to say how much they dislike me and how \u201cjust because I have degrees, doesn\u2019t mean that I know everything\u201d. She was really offended at my attempt to politely cut off her daughter, and then blamed us for \u201cnot trying to understand her\u201d. My mum explained to her that it is not our responsibility to understand her daughter or her issues, but as her mother, my aunt is expected to. This further aggregated her and she stopped speaking to my mum. After what she said about me I no longer wanted to interact with her so I just ignored her.\n\nA few weeks pass and in person, she approaches my mum and I and starts yelling about how we are \u201ccharacterless\u201d because my father is not in the picture and how my mum is a terrible parent and has raised poorly mannered children. When I told her that her own child is so poorly mannered that she body shames me and other people, her reply was \u201cmaybe if you didn\u2019t eat so much you wouldn\u2019t be so fat\u201d. I was disgusted and told her that she should \u201cfocus on her daughter\u2019s mental health and own eating disorder first before worrying about other people\u201d. I felt bad about this comment after saying it but I also was so sick of the jabs that her and her daughter constantly make at me. She then told me that \u201cI hope bad things happen to you. Everything that has happened to you up till this moment you deserve and I hope they keep happening\u201d. It was absolutely terrifying and revolting to know that someone that \u201cclose to me\u201d wished such evil upon me. She also said that I must think I\u2019m some sort of celebrity because I have friends and so does my mum, and that we are too good for her and her daughter. I have always tried to include my cousin in outings and parties, but she\u2019s always horrible to me and tries to turn my friends against me at them.\n\nShe then told me to get out of the house. This took place at my grandparents\u2019, where I live, due to space issues at my mum\u2019s place round the corner. She declared that everyone was just waiting for me to leave anyways and that nobody wants me there. She also told my mum that it \u201cis embarrassing that she can\u2019t keep her own daughter at home and that she even drove her husband away.\u201d For context my dad was abusive and a cheater and my mum left him, not the other way around.\n\nThe next day I got a horrible message from my cousin\u2019s step dad which said:\n\n\u201cIt is very upsetting to as how you have spoken to my wife yesterday.The bullying, constant abuse by all of you as a family and insults, is not something i am accepting. This is utterly out of line, inhuman and Not At All Sain. This certainly has caused a very heavy  damage - As a matter of fact this message, i know will have no meaning to you, but it does to me. How dare you speak to my wife in such a manner. Embarrasingly Ashaming. If anything do not reply to me.\u201d\n\nI blocked him after receiving that.\n\nI apologise for this post being so long and very layered, but I currently feel so so low and scared to be living here and anxious with the amount of hate I am receiving from family. And the worst part is that my cousin started all of this yet hasn\u2019t opened her mouth once since the trip. Half the family have ganged up on me after she had her \u201cpanic attack\u201d at the airport. The reason I say \u201cpanic attack\u201d is because her and her mum have this tendency to behave erratically and explosively as soon as they feel defensive or that they are not getting the reaction they want. This has happened before.\n\nI feel incredibly alone and fearful, as I have nowhere else to go and now know I need to start thinking of a plan to move out soon. I\u2019ve experienced a lot of stress with family, regarding my horrible father and the feelings that come with that, and now my family who I thought would be able to support me have told me that they hate me and are counting down the days to when I leave or something bad happens to me. I haven\u2019t spoken to any of them since because it makes me angry when they accuse me and they refuse to hear me out or believe anyone on that trip who vouches for me not initiating an argument. I feel defeated and extremely nervous for what\u2019s to come.  Am I overreacting?\n\nI read all of the comments on the post I uploaded last night and I really appreciate the kind words. Thank you for whoever told me I forgot to cross out the name on one picture! ",

After speaking with Nani and everyone involved, I feel like the conversation I had with you was very different. I don't really understand how much gentler anyone expected me to be. I approached her very calmly and tried to reassure her that we weren't arguing and that I didn't mean to cause offence if she took any. She decided to escalate it to the shouting and crying. I no longer can be bothered to try to preserve a relationship with you simply because it is a huge waste of time for me and quite frankly it's exhausting. I understand it has nothing to do with my mum either and I respect that we are now all adults here and should be able to deal with relationships independently from other members of the family. But I am genuinely hurt and disgusted by your behaviour and comments towards me, my appearance and other people's and honestly I'm glad to remove her from my circle. I look like an idiot each time I try to reconcile and if you'd like to believe her narrative that is fine by me because I know and everyone else knows what happened on that trip was not as she decides to tell it. I hope that she can find peace within herself and eventually get the help that she needs, because as much as I try to look out for her never once has she benefiting me due to her outbursts and unkind behaviour. Hope that this is well understood and that you can also feel that you can come to me directly rather than my mother, who was upset too, but didn't feel the need to escalate it the way she did. It was a significant overreaction and if she has panic attacks that's upsetting for her, but she was looking for a fight as she usually is and she stirred one up.

        "Background": "I feel like I\u2019m overreacting because my sister said I was but let me ask yall. \n\nTo keep it short and sweet, my daughter ( F15 fake name Lia ) has a boyfriend (M16) and those two are inseparable and it\u2019s my daughter\u2019s first and only boyfriend that I\u2019m aware of. But what comes from teen relationships is experimenting and last Sunday night It was like 3am my daughter snuck him in and it woke me and to keep it PG I caught them in the \u201dact\u201c and I ofcourse sent the kid home but I knew I had to talk to his parents because if personally I would want someone to tell me if the shoe was on the other foot.\n\nSo the entire day I\u2019m dreading making this call to his parents thinking that they will for sure be mad at me or blame my daughter, when we finally connected and I also know his parents because I grew up with the father and my late husband was drinking buddies with him. But his wife I\u2019m not too familiar with and I have interacted with about a handful of times. But she is who I ended up talking on the phone with and I told her about the incident and her immediate response was \u201c oh that\u2019s it ?\u201d But once she realized I was laughing along she recovered and said \u201cwell I\u2019ll talk to him about doing that because that\u2019s inappropriate for him to sneak into someone\u2019s house.\u201d That when I told her thank you and we kinda get side tracked and started talking about their relationship and that\u2019s when she I guys felt comfortable and told me. \u201cOh I been knew they were active since August\u201d that\u2019s when I followed up how did she know and not tell me?  She says she found out when she did a phone snoop on her son\u2019s phone and found a folder in his photo gallery with Lia\u2019s name and she thought she was going to see cute photos of them. But apparently she found X-rated videos of them both in this folder doing the deed.\n\nI kinda started actively get upset with Her because what do you mean you found CP of your son and my child and didn\u2019t think it was urgent enough to tell me. Her defense was her son never sent them to anyone because she checked the messages with his friend and saw that he didn\u2019t send them and also that she made him delete it so the problem was solved\u2026.But apparently her son told her that the reason why Lia let him record it was because, she was struggling with her mental health and wanted to take a break with having sex and to help his \u201curges\u201d during the dry month they started doing home films. But it all makes sense why she dumped him for a bit and she refused to tell me why. That\u2019s when I told her I think it\u2019s best for our kids not to see each other for a while and I quickly got off the phone with her warranting this text above.\n\nI talked to my sister about this and she thinks I\u2019m overreacting by wanting to restrict them from seeing each other, and my daughter is going to interpret it as I\u2019m punishing her for having sex and that their kids they\u2019re going to do it anyway but just become more sneaky about it which will be worse, And as far as the videos if the mother did delete them then the problem is solved.

        "Background": "I\u2019m (40m) on a road trip on the east coast with my kid (12m) and parked at a campground in the middle of upstate NY. It\u2019s 10:30pm and we\u2019re both sitting on the front seat of a rental van just about to go super and be down for the night. I hear my phone ringing and it\u2019s a friend I haven\u2019t heard from in a long time. I haven\u2019t seen him in 20+ years and we maybe talk once every 3 years. Our conversations are always reminiscing the past high school days and honestly, I didn\u2019t know much about his current life nor did he mine. He was 1 of 2 good friends I spent a lot of time with during the first couple years of high school, but he was 5-6 years older and had already graduated but we were his only friends. To be honest, the other friend and I to this day, don\u2019t know his real first name. We\u2019ve always called him by a nickname. I\u2019ll refer to him as Peter.\n\nI answer the phone and I can hear he is in a bad place, mind you.. he still lives in the Midwest in the same exact house we used to get crazy high in. His wife is pregnant and he didn\u2019t want another kid but she did after having many miscarriages.. their other kid is the same age as mine. He hasn\u2019t worked in 7 months and is seriously in debt putting everything on credit cards (so he says) and behind two months in his mortgage. The call ends after an hour of talking him down from suicidal thoughts and feeling like I gave him hope to get a job or something. The thing is.. his wife had no idea he isn\u2019t working nor that they\u2019re in hundreds of thousands in debt. He explains he can\u2019t tell her because she\u2019ll get stressed and may have another miscarriage. I offered to help in whatever way I could, not financially but at least pointing him in the right direction. The call ends and things felt better. \n\nHe called me the next day a couple times and he apologized but felt he had to ask\u2026 to borrow $15,000. He said he has a loan shark after him threatening his house and family and he\u2019s desperate. I said I will see what I can do, but I want to see his financial documents. Mortgage stub, CC statements, bank statements etc. He got a little quiet and then told me he doesn\u2019t have a mortgage. His parents paid off the house a long time ago.. I thought OK that makes sense. However, the last call he told me he was two months behind and his mortgage I asked for him to clarify and he said what he meant by mortgage is the money that he pays his parents which is $700 a month. I got a little irritated because our last conversation I kept saying that he needs to pay his mortgage so he doesn\u2019t lose his house and he never clarified after I kept repeating that. \n\nI started to feel like he was being dishonest with me so I wanted to contact our other friend who I\u2019ve actually remained in contact with a lot better and have seen him probably 10 times and last 20 years. I\u2019ll refer to him as Johnny. I got a hold of Johnny and asked if he had talked to our other friend (Peter) lately and they did speak just a few days prior apparently and Peter was asking a bunch of questions about work and how much Johnny gets paid and what else is new in life. Johnny didn\u2019t know that Peter\u2018s wife was pregnant or that Peter was having any issues. They had a normal conversation and then Peter started asking questions about me. Johnny knew that I owned my own business and had moved to the West Coast years ago so he told Peter of the success I was having. \n\nAfter Johnny told me this, I got really weirded out. I didn\u2019t know what to believe from Peter or if any of it was true. Johnny and I joked that we had Peter saved in our phones under the same name and that we didn\u2019t know his real name. We also joked that Peter was like a ninja, we spent so much time together when we were younger, but we never really knew anything about him. \n\nHe then sent the following messages and I lost my shit. He keeps calling one after the other without leaving a VM and the whole thing feels very off. AIO? \n\nTLDR: Old secretive friend calls after 20 years asking to borrow $15k but isn\u2019t being honest with his wife or me. Calls and texts persistently after telling him I\u2019d see what I could do and that I\u2019d get back to him. Keeps persisting, I\u2019ve declined to help at all. ",

They\u2019ve known each other since they were 14 years old. They still keep in contact with each other, almost everyday. Tbh I don\u2019t care. I accepted their friendship. We\u2019ve had arguments about how I\u2019ve felt about her, \nsometimes the conversation went well and other times it didn\u2019t. Her and I (29f) are friends (well idk I mean I talk to her when I see her, I\u2019m civil w her, I don\u2019t ever give her attitude, I met her current husband and her baby~9 months, but honestly I have a wall up) so that\u2019s why she has my number. I\u2019m trying to make things work for all of us because I respect him. My boyfriend is a wonderful guy, he isn\u2019t cheating on me with her, he is over her completely and she told me she is too. I just don\u2019t really trust her. \n\nShe texted me, I responded, she replied and I sent that \u201cI appreciate you..\u201d text and she cried to him about it(mins or secs after send that to her). My boyfriend was furious because he\u2019s going thru a dark time in his life and I\u2019m adding to the flame. He told me that he wanted to see the message because she might have overreacted. Once he saw my \u201cI appreciate you\u201d text, he felt that it was unnecessary and immature. He told me he isn\u2019t going to listen to my side and he\u2019s not going to understand it. \nIdk if he seen the other text messages after the \u201cI appreciate you\u201d text. Here are the other messages. \n\nFor those saying I did overreact, I can slightly agree. I could have come across a bit nicer, however I felt a certain way and idc what you say about me. I felt the way I did and that\u2019s that! None of you can take that away from me. Just like I can\u2019t take away how she felt when she read my \u201cI appreciate you..\u201d message. I feel bad for coming off too strong and not making it clear on how I felt. However she is a GROWN ASS WOMEN and she can cry to her OWN husband until my man is in a better mindset. I don\u2019t agree with her crying to him at all. I think it was too much, but I do see that it would hurt her because she\u2019s trying to be nice. However my feelings still are valid just as must as hers. I\u2019m posting the whole thing just so it\u2019s easier for ppl that don\u2019t know the whole story. \n\nAlso! I really tried to be nice to her and try to get her to understand me or at least heard. Maybe I didn\u2019t do I good job? Honestly, at the last end of the text messages, I couldn\u2019t be patient anymore so I laughed at her message. I know that was immature, I was just so exhausted at that point.

        "Background": "For context, my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year. When we first got together, we went to the gym frequently, but over time that tapered off. These days, I go alone, which I don\u2019t mind since it helps me clear my head. However, recently, he mentioned wanting to do more things together, so we made some plans. Later, I brought up how I\u2019d love to go to the gym together again\u2014not all the time, just once or twice a week. He has a lot of free time on weekdays, so I figured it was reasonable.\n\nA few days ago, we were getting ready to go to the gym together. The only issue was that he brought up that he had to meet a friend around the same time, so he was in a bit of a time crunch. This frustrated me slightly, because it felt like he couldn't prioritise something that was important to to me, but it's not a big deal as we can always go another time.\n\nSince I was ready first, I started tidying up the apartment. I noticed the kitchen sink was clogged with rice from when he washed his pot\u2014rice that had been sitting there for four or five days. I had asked him multiple times to clean it, and while he finally did the night before, he left a pile of rice in the sink. Since we\u2019ve had drainage issues before, I wanted to clear it out before we left.\n\nAt this point, I was getting irritated. He was standing next to me while I cleaned, continuing to take his time getting ready instead of helping. Then, I noticed his stuff scattered all over the kitchen. I asked if he could put it away before we left\u2014it would have only taken a few seconds. But what really pushed me over the edge was when I turned around and saw socks on the dining table.\n\nThis is a huge boundary for me. He has a habit of throwing clothes all over the place, which I\u2019ve brought up multiple times before. Seeing socks on the table where we and our guests are supposed to eat made me snap. I told him to grow up and clean up after himself. We argued. I know I could have been more thoughtful - but I've become less tolerant of this issue.\n\nDespite the tension, we left together and took two buses to the gym. By this point, I was still frustrated, he asked if I'd continue being mad at him all day and he ended up sitting separately on the 2nd bus. That\u2019s when the attached messages started.\n\nTo me, it felt like he was bombarding me with messages regardless of what I said. I explained my frustration, but he kept pushing without building on what were talking about. I was really trying to get this resolved before we got off. This wasnt getting resolved. So, I bluntly texted him I needed space and just wanted to focus on working out. It seemed like he agreed to giving eachother space.\n\nWhen we got to the bus stop, I left for the gym alone since we had both agreed to take space. I knew he was meeting his friend that was close anyway, so I figured it was fine. But instead of leaving, he followed me into the gym.\n\nHe asked to use my locker, I told him directly there are other lockers with integrated locks available and he was leaving soon anyway. While I was on the treadmill, he interrupted me to ask again if I was going to be mad all day.\n\nAt this point, I was really overwhelmed. My mind was racing, and I just told him to leave me alone. That\u2019s when the gym texts started.\n\nHis messages really threw me off\u2014he was apologising one second, guilt-tripping me the next, then victimising himself, and dismissing my need for space. The wildest part was when he threatened to never go to the gym with me again and then ended with \"lmao be stressed\" after I asked once more for space. It felt claustrophobic, like I was expected to immediately regulate my emotions and act like nothing had happened\u2014 to comfort him- even though my boundaries had been repeatedly ignored.\n\nEventually, he ran a bit on the treadmill while I stretched, then he left.\n\nI finished my workout, used the sauna, and went home. I spent a few hours cooking and relaxing on my computer, trying to clear my head. Later, I decided to go for a bike ride to get some fresh air. It felt great.\n\nThen, I got a message from him: \"Woke up to see you\u2019ve left. Not a nice feeling\"\n\nAt that point, I just thought\u2014 do I really have to explain myself after everything that happened? Freedom is a big thing for me, he knows this, and it felt suffocating to be tracked like that. When I got home, I went straight to bed.\n\nI didn\u2019t hear a word from him all day. Later, I headed to the gym alone. As soon as I left the house, he flooded me with messages.\n\nI refused to engage in that cycle again. I thought, why didn\u2019t he bring this up when I was home? So I just told him we\u2019d talk after my session\u2014I didn\u2019t want to associate my gym time with negativity.\n\nI also texted (not in the screenshots) that I\u2019d let him know when I was ready to talk. Looking back, I get what he was trying to say, but completely ignoring my need for space and then demanding an apology felt like too much. I knew I needed to apologise for snapping in the kitchen, but he was hyper-fixating on what happened at the gym\u2014as if I had forced him to be there.\n\nAnother day went by. By the end of it, I started the conversation. We talked everything through, I ordered pizza, and watched a show together. He cooked some chicken for me, and it felt like things were back to normal.\n\nBut I still can\u2019t shake the weird feeling from his texts.\n\nDuring our talk, he kept pushing the narrative that I made him uncomfortable, embarrassed, and insecure at the gym\u2014but in the moment, I felt like I was under so much pressure and had no room to breathe. It felt inescapable. All I said was that I needed to be left alone, but he kept engaging with me. He also said the socks were actually clean, and 'they smelled fine' - sure... I'm just confused why he didn't just say that when I brought it up on the day. He said he was struggling while I was taking space, almost talked to me, but admitted he didn't want to be the first one to talk because then he'd be letting me 'win'? - just really strange.\n\nI didn\u2019t straight up tell him I found his messages manipulative, but I did say I was weirded out by them. Now, I\u2019m just trying to get some outside perspective.\n\nDoes this seem manipulative, or just bad communication? Whenever I needed space before, he'd become passive aggressive, sarcastic etc... Am I overreacting? ",

        "Background": "My older brother (39M) and I (32M) have never been extremely close because we have very little in common, but we get along well enough when we see each other at family gatherings and holidays. We rarely ever have disagreements, but we also keep our conversations very surface-level (usually just talking about pop culture or his kids). I came out of the closet at a very young age, and my family was always very supportive and accepting. I grew up in a Christian household, yet never felt judged or condemned by my own family. I attended Christian schools and felt incredibly uncomfortable there, but I had a safe space at home to be myself. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until September of this year, when I got engaged to my partner of 5 years, that my sexuality suddenly became an issue. I am not a Christian or a member of any religion, for that matter. My brother, on the other hand, has become increasingly devout over the last two decades, especially after meeting his wife in ~2013. They are the type of Christians who believe doing yoga invites the devil into your body, and Satan is influencing the election. So yeah, I just avoid the subject of religion around them.\n\nWhen I announced the engagement in the family group chat, I only received congratulatory messages from my sister, my mom, and a half brother of mine. The brother from these screenshots, his wife, and my dad said nothing (though I later spoke to my dad). I found that really odd. I later discussed it with my sister, and she agreed it was weird, and thought maybe they were just busy (my brother has 4 kids and an engineering career) but would say something eventually. The engagement was announced on 9/22 and I didn\u2019t hear anything from him until 10/11, when he sent me the text shown here. \n\nAfter I sent my reply, I blocked his number. I know this may seem extreme. But in my mind, I could not imagine continuing a brotherly relationship with him knowing that he does not support or respect my right to marry. Why should he be able to compartmentalize his relationship with me like that? I guess my sister talked to him about it, and he said he felt that as the \u201cleader of his family\u201d he didn\u2019t want to set a bad example for his children. But my partner and I have been around his kids countless times, and it was never an issue until now.\n\nHis birthday just passed and for the first time in probably 25 years, I didn\u2019t wish him a happy birthday.

I told him I\u2019m very in love with my boyfriend, loyal to him, and I\u2019d never jeopardize my relationship. My boyfriend treats me better than anyone has before, and I want to respect him fully. I even offered for my friend to meet my bf, but he flat-out said no.\n\nThat really rubbed me the wrong way. It feels like he disrespected my relationship and my boundaries by even entertaining this. I feel like if he truly valued me as a friend, he wouldn\u2019t put me in this position.\n\nNow I\u2019m leaning toward cutting him off completely, even though he\u2019s been my best friend for years.

There are 9 children total. We\u2019ve known a family since I was born basically, they were missionaries to a country in Asia, and my older brother we\u2019ll call him Z (m31) went over to help this missionary family build something (he works in construction) and met the niece of this families mom (who is very Asian) and they got married. This family\u2019s mom T is very manipulative (typical Asian from what I hear) This Asian family is also my husbands cousins by marriage, so we can just say we\u2019re all tied together we know them very very well. Me and H used to go over to their house all the time and spend the weekends with them, also going on vacations with them. \nSo now that I\u2019ve set up the scenario, like 2-3 years ago H took a trip with their family back to Asia and they brought back an Asian girl A (her parents were very close with the missionary family) and her and H have gotten very close over the past few years. \nI should also add that H is a closeted gay man and A has known this since she met him. He\u2019s never come out because he knew what would happen with our overly religious/homophobic families, he still lives at my parents house. So recently T manipulated A to tell her that my brother is gay and has been (fornicating) with other men eye roll. And they\u2019ve made this whole huge deal and said they\u2019re going to tell my parents and Jacob\u2019s boss who\u2019s also my brother, and this could very well ruin his life because of the nature of him being gay. And I\u2019m like the only person that\u2019s on my brothers and there for him, basically everyone we know that knows about this situation is telling him that\u2019s he\u2019s wrong. \n\n\nBelow is the messages between me and the girl that outed my brother (who is a close friend of mine and his) ",

I spent that night crying and hoping he\u2019d reply, but he never did. I didn\u2019t flood him with messages or calls but I waited and cried so much i got a fever. The next day, I forced myself to put it aside and focus on studying.\n\nThe day after my exam, when I returned to school, he didn\u2019t even look at me. I was devastated inside but didn\u2019t show it. He knew I was hurting, and when my friends asked, I just told them we had broken up. I left school early that day, making up a health excuse.\n\nThe next day, after class, he pulled me aside and said he wanted to talk. I stayed silent and let him speak. Then he told me it was all a dare, a prank, that he never really wanted to break up. He said he planned to tell me right after, but when I didn\u2019t \"fight\" for us, he got hurt. He was embarrassed because he did it in front of all his friends, and it looked like I didn\u2019t care that much. So, he wanted to see if I\u2019d just let us end without trying.\n\nI was stunned.

Maybe it\u2019s just the way that I perceived it. And it\u2019s also like she knows I would never hook up with the guy like I\u2019m a 20-year-old virgin all of my friends have had sex with multiple people. I\u2019ve never even had a boyfriend and I fear it\u2019s not gonna happen for a while but I\u2019m not like I\u2019m not the type to like fuck someone\u2019s best friend so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what she\u2019s worried of or something.

I am woken up by a very loud knocking at my door and am greeted by my landlord, Angie, and her son, who we\u2019ll call Jason. My landlord then asks me the same question regarding whether I was moving out and I explain to him the situation and how I already told the building manager earlier that week. I then take this moment to ask for a new mailbox key, as I had lost mine and despite texting the Angie about it, hadn\u2019t heard any response. Jason translates and we agree on the fee. \n\nThey want to make sure that the extra copy they have in the storage room is the correct key, so Jason takes me down into the lobby to unlock my mailbox and allows me to get the mail that was piling up from the past few days. He then asks \u201cSo now that you\u2019re single, what are you doing for Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d I immediately suspect that he\u2019s trying to hint at taking me out, and respond \u201cI\u2019m going to be working.. yeah, I don\u2019t plan on dating anybody for a LONG time.\u201d We go back upstairs, I reconfirm with my landlord that I\u2019ll get the cash for the key, and they leave. \n\nFast forward to today, Feb 25.. I get a follow request on instagram from an account I don\u2019t recognize. I look at the profile picture and immediately recognized it as Jason. Just to verify my suspicions, I send a message saying \u201cHi do I know you?\u201d The picture shows his responses.. I am thoroughly creeped out and not sure where to go from here.. Being the paranoid person I am.. my mind immediately went to \u201cWhat if he comes into my apartment when I\u2019m not there?\u201d, as I know for sure that he also has access to the storage room with the copies of tenants keys.. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just overreacting but how can I shut down this conversation without worrying about any sort of retaliation? \n\nTL;DR- My apartment building maintenance-lady\u2019s son, who I\u2019ve only spoken to on maybe two occasions (and only regarding apartment issues), found out my name by reading his mother\u2019s messages with me and then proceeded to follow me on instagram and message me, despite me explicitly telling him a few weeks ago that I have no interest in being with anybody for a long time.

        "Background": "I\u2019ve been dating this guy I\u2019ve known for years. We\u2019re both 30. I got out of my only relationship about five years ago, then had a bad accident three years ago that needed foot surgery. I basically stopped dating until recently. I lost a lot of support from people during that time, but he was always just kind of there, maybe because his parents still live near mine.\n\nLately he\u2019s been doing something that really bothers me. He keeps bringing up his female friends and their babies, always baby girls. He\u2019ll randomly text me about them, send pictures of the babies or even ultrasound photos, and bring them up in conversations that have nothing to do with it. The one that really throws me off is a friend from grad school (I\u2019ve never met) who had a baby girl three months ago. She hasn\u2019t even let him visit yet, but he talks about her and the baby like he\u2019s part of their family. It makes me uncomfortable FOR her and the baby and I\u2019m not sure if she even knows that he\u2019s sharing her ultrasound photos with people she doesn\u2019t know. \n\nLast weekend we went out for breakfast and he couldn\u2019t stop talking about how important his job is. He was checking his phone the whole time on a Sunday and bragging about volunteering to work weekends for an extra $150 to $200. When I asked if he\u2019s a workaholic he said yes.

        "Background": "26M here. I just got out of a nearly 2-year relationship with a woman \u2014 let\u2019s call her L She ended things on Pride Day, and I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m fine\u2026 but honestly, I feel broken, confused, and betrayed on too many levels to count.\n\nFrom the outside, we looked like a blended family. She had four kids. I loved them like they were mine. They even called me \u201cdaddy.\u201d But inside that home, I always felt like a stranger. Unwelcome. Misunderstood. Even the kids started calling me \u201cmean,\u201d while I was doing my best to step into a role no one prepared me for \u2014 and no one appreciated.\n\nHer baby daddy \u2014 let\u2019s talk about that.\n\nShe says they were \u201cbest friends before anything,\u201d but the truth is, he was always in the picture. Always given priority. She idolized him. Every good thing that happened in his life, she celebrated like it was her own. I was expected to just accept it. To \u201cnot be insecure.\u201d But they were always together \u2014 laughing, texting, running errands, even going to therapy together \u201cfor their daughter.\u201d\n\nI tried to be the mature one. I talked to him. I treated him with respect. But even he has doubts about her. He\u2019s admitted that he thinks she\u2019s \u201cf***ing around\u201d \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t know what to do in my position. That says a lot.\n\nAt this point, I realize all she wants from me is sex. When we broke up, she still came to me like nothing changed. I fell for it every time \u2014 not because I\u2019m stupid, but because I was clinging to crumbs of affection and false hope. I wanted to believe there was still something real underneath it all. But sex became the only time I felt close to her. And even that felt transactional.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the beginning.\n\nEarly on, I caught her still talking to two dudes she had flings with before \u2014 she had their conversations muted and hidden. She told me it was \u201cnothing,\u201d but she was sleeping with her baby daddy and two or three other men when we first got together. She says I \u201chold it over her,\u201d but how can I not be affected when I started this relationship thinking I had her full attention \u2014 only to learn later I was one of many?\n\nThere\u2019s even speculation she slept with one of my friends. I lost a friendship over that \u2014 and so did she. Her friend left her because she also believed L f*ed her boyfriend, who happened to be my friend too. Everyone whispers that she\u2019s a h, but I always gave her the benefit of the doubt. I never wanted to see her that way. I wanted to see her as misunderstood, healing, layered.\n\nBut her own sister keeps her secrets, brushes me off, and just says, \u201cYou need to move on.\u201d\n\nThe gaslighting has been constant. The emotional punishment for reacting to her behavior has been relentless. If I express hurt, I\u2019m \u201ctoo sensitive.\u201d If I raise my voice, I\u2019m \u201ccrazy.\u201d If I try to leave, I\u2019m guilted into staying \u2014 with sex, with silence, with small doses of affection just enough to keep me loyal.\n\nI\u2019ve lost myself in this. I left everything behind to be with her. Now I\u2019m stranded in her house, not on the lease, surrounded by reminders of a woman who broke me, while Philly shelters are full and I have nowhere to go.\n\nAnd still\u2026 she makes me the villain.\n\nShe left me with her kids FOUR times this past week \u2014 after we broke up. She\u2019d say \u201cI\u2019ll be back in 15 minutes,\u201d then disappear for hours with her baby daddy. I said clearly: \u201cIf we\u2019re not together, I\u2019m not your babysitter.\u201d And still she left.\n\nThe final straw? Midnight. I was sick. Her baby daddy pulled up again. Said they were going to \u201chave a talk and get liquor.\u201d I said, \u201cNo. I\u2019m not doing this again. I\u2019m sick. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m not watching the kids.\u201d She stared me down\u2026 and walked out. Didn\u2019t argue. Didn\u2019t hesitate. Just left.\n\nThis whole relationship has been:\nShe violates \u2192 I react \u2192 I get punished.\nShe screams \u2192 I speak up \u2192 I\u2019m the abuser.\nShe cheats \u2192 I hurt \u2192 I\u2019m \u201ctoo emotional.\u201d\n\nAnd somehow, everyone believes her side. She tells her family and friends that I\u2019m the toxic one. Meanwhile, I validated her. Listened. Apologized. Took accountability. Even when I was hurting. Even when I had every right to break down.\n\nThere\u2019s no intimacy anymore. No affection unless I ask. No sex unless I initiate. Our \u201cquality time\u201d was silence. And now I\u2019m here \u2014 feeling like a pet she left in the cage while she lives her life out loud.\n\nShe calls me crazy. Her friends think I\u2019m the problem.\n\nBut if you sacrificed everything, only to be lied to, manipulated, isolated, and used \u2014 and then blamed when you finally broke\u2026\n\nWouldn\u2019t you start to question your sanity too?\n\n\nTL;DR:\n26M. Just got out of a nearly 2-year relationship with a woman who had 4 kids and a too-close relationship with her baby daddy. She cheated early on, hid messages, and used me emotionally and sexually while manipulating how others saw me. She constantly left me stranded with her kids post-breakup, dismissed my boundaries, and punished me emotionally anytime I reacted to her behavior. I\u2019m now stuck in her house with nowhere to go, being labeled the \"crazy one\" while all I did was love her, try, and lose everything in the process. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m crazy or just finally broken.\n\nI used Chatgpt to edit this\n\n",

If there's something I did that rubbed you the wrong way, I'm open to hearing it, but I also want to be upfront that I felt disrespected by the name-calling. Let me know if you're up for talking it out or if we can just agree to move forward on good terms so that we can have a good time at the party. I don't think there's any reason for any animosity between us, at least for sake. We are gonna be spending almost an entire day in close proximity and I'm sure we will both be drinking and the last thing I want is for there to be any kind of tension in the air that might cause an altercation.\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Speaker B\", \"text\": \"It was childish of me.

(for context she has always been somewhat \u201cfat phobic\u201d or judge-mental of curvier girls) everytime i go to make myself a meal (9 times out of 10 this would be my first meal of the day) she will make comments like \u201cthat\u2019s too many carbs!\u201d or \u201cwhy do you eat so much??\u201d and im left feeling like a fat slob. \nfast forward to today- me and my boyfriend came home from the mall with new clothes that i had bought bc most of my old clothes didn\u2019t really fit me appropriately anymore.\ni bought new jeans bc i had bought these same jeans less than a year ago and those ones didn\u2019t fit me after the sudden weight gain so i got ones to fit me as i am now. \nwell- when i got home my mom asked me what i got and so i showed her. when she saw the jeans i said \u201cyeah i had to get another pair bc the other pair doesn\u2019t really fit me anymore haha\u201d and she said \u201ci bet they\u2019ll fit me! let me try them on ! i\u2019m smaller than you! i know they\u2019ll fit me! you weight more than me u know they\u2019ll fit me!\u201d i was pretty uncomfortable with it so i said \u201ci feel like you\u2019re going to body shame me if i let you so , no.\u201d and she said \u201ci won\u2019t!\u201d \nso\u2026\ni let her.\nand she tries them on and comes into my room and shows me.\nshe goes, \u201clook at your 67 yr old mother fitting into jeans that don\u2019t even fit you anymore!!!\u201d \n(p.s. they didn\u2019t even fit her. they were squeezing the life out of her waist.)\ni told her \u201cthey look way too tight.\u201d and she denied it. \nthen after she had left my room she texts me this (image inserted) and it looks like she\u2019s just trying to make me feel bad??? \nalso she had asked me how much i weighed and i told her \u201cabout 135lbs? idk that\u2019s what i saw last\u201d and she didn\u2019t believe me and proceeded to tell me \u201cYOU ARE NOT 135lbs\u201d \u201cYOURE SOOOO MUCH BIGGER THAN ME\u201d so i just ignored her bc she makes me feel so bad about myself. anyways- im so sorry about the long post- but am i overreacting?? is my mom being mean? thank you for reading if you did.

She has a young kid who is teething and she just got him down so she couldn\u2019t come pick you up but her fianc\u00e9 will be home later so she can take you back to your hotel once you\u2019re done with dinner and visiting your godson. What is a girl alone in the city to do but to call an uber. It\u2019s safe\u2026 right? Reliable\u2026 right??? Their drivers have been vetted\u2026 right????? \n\nUber \u201cCharles\u201d accepts your reservation and is 3 minutes away. You see on the map that he\u2019s just around the corner so all he needs is to bust a quick left and pick you up. But he doesn\u2019t do that\u2026 he sends you a random phone number in the app and says \u201ccall me.\u201d \n\nNow I\u2019m a travelled person. I\u2019ve had Ubers in the past call me through the app (and before that feature was a thing they called from their cellphones) and I\u2019m distracted because I was already on the phone so I didn\u2019t think twice about ending my current call to touch base because I\u2019m already late for dinner with my friend and I really need to get going. \n\nThis is where it gets weird\u2026 I call the number and nobody answers. Instead I immediately get a text from some other number (possibly associated with a 3rd party uber service). I question the driver in the app about it and he says \u201cSend the code sent to you so I can open your location on Uber map\u201d (this is a direct quote from the message). I respond saying \u201cI\u2019ve never had to do this before\u201d super creeped out because I\u2019m watching his location just around the corner NOT MOVING. He proceeds to send the same \u201ccode\u201d twice more. \n\nI immediately see flashes of being hacked - both digitally and into little tiny human pieces. So I request a new driver because I\u2019ve still got life to live and a decent credit score to live it with. \n\nSo tell me\u2026 did I overreact? ",

My mom said she would get back to her soon but I never heard an update. I was in florida with my dad and my girlfriend for a month so I honestly forgot that there was a potential call that happened until I returned. My mom pulled me aside and asked if I had let G drive my car. I said no and she said that G's parents saw her get into the driver's seat. So I vouched for my girlfriend and G and said she probably was checking out my car. Now G's parents are more strict with her hanging out with me because of this.

        "Background": "Hi All,\n\nI posted this review for this listing:\u00a0[Ocean view of Punta del Este! Playa Mansa. Port. - Apartments for Rent in Punta del Este, Departamento de Maldonado, Uruguay - Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1097112774740107334?source_impression_id=p3_1746807353_P3k_tUU_yNaxi11K)\u00a0\\---\u00a0[Juliana Fotia](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/563423739)\n\nApril 2025 Juliana is a wonderful person and she has a place in a perfect location! Her place has so much potential! The challenge is it needs quite a bit of maintenance and some updates to layout that can be difficult to manage as an older person. For example the bathroom had a shower with no stall (wet bathroom) or sinks that were so low they were designed for children. Two of the three bathrooms seem very fancy just very difficult to use as the sinks and toilet placements make getting through the door difficult or you constantly got wet from washing your hands. Some of the plumbing just needs some TLC. The kitchen cabinets are getting old so you need to be careful opening them. And the smell of gas from exhaust in the garage can be a bit overwhelming besides the fact they have a firepit grill in the house which also smells. The laundry machine was also broken but Juliana was kind enough to offer us free laundry service. I wish her all the best and I hope this review helps when booking.\n\nHer Response on my profile!!!:\u00a0[Juliana Fotia](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/563423739)\u00a0April 2025Horrible experiencia. No recomiendo!!! Exige reembolso sin justificaci\u00f3n. No lo volver\u00e9 a alojar jam\u00e1s.\n\nMy response after that: Please review my review of her place. I always try to find the silver lining but in this case it was difficult. I wish Juliana the best and hope she can fix the problems for her guests in the future.\n\nAirBnB won't post my review because it violates some sort of policy but they won't tell me what. On the other hand they won't take down her post even though I shared all the details of the mold, dirt, bathrooms with no shower stall, broken coffee machine and broken laundry machine. So I get a ding on my profile and she gets off scott free! So frustrated. I have all the pictures of the broken down place that I shared with AirBnB and this lady and they say no it is fine to have moldy hair and junk all over her house with broken things... Odd thing is I got out of the house immediately and AirBnB gave me a refund for the nights not stayed. So I guess its ok to give a refund for a place that is crap but to try and find a silver lining when posting a review for a shithole is not allowed. Guess we can't tell the truth in this world anymore. Even when coated with sugar but yes you will be penalized... you are always at fault.",

        "Background": "I can't help but feel like the world's biggest asshole even though I genuinely think I'm doing what has to be done so I wanted to ask the public, I've never made a post like this before\n\nI (now 19M) was pretty much the primary caregiver of my mother after she had a stroke for about a year from like half my senior year when I was ~17/18 on, managed to graduate HS and everything but was stuck at the house basically 24/7 when it ended as the youngest who wasn't taught to drive & was working on a permit when shit hit the fan\n\nMy family was always pretty terrible at communication but the 2nd youngest (5 years older than me)(('John')) takes the cake and brought his gf(('Doe')) who is equally aggressive when it comes to any sort of criticism into the house a few years before this all happened\n(ex. I spent 6 hours cleaning up the entire house while also taking care of my mother, asked Doe the morning after if she could clean 3 big cast irons she'd dirtied frying food for herself and she berated me saying she was too busy being responsible insta-carting instead)\n\nThings just kept escalating in that sort of way and they kept ignoring me apart from chastising me loud enough for me to hear from upstairs, I kept telling my dad and he kept telling me he 'was sure they aren't doing it on purpose' / 'i'll clean the cast irons, you know its hard to talk to them' and nothing ever changed for the better, it just kept getting worse\n\nThis was until one day I tried to tell Doe there was a salad ready in the fridge for John to have for lunch and she just straight up entirely intentionally ignored me.\nSo I finally tried to talk to John directly about how im a person who appreciates communicating using words; Which turned out to be a massive fucking mistake because he started almost immediately yelling at me about how I was being immature by trying to talk about it when Doe could hear me and it was pissing her off etc etc, insulted me told me he hated me and I was useless because there was dust behind the tv and shit and he started screaming for me to put my hands on him and see what hed do and he just kept saying that over and over intermittently even when I gave up and went to back off to go upstairs quietly so I turned around where I stood at the bottom and slowly just rested my hand under his collarbone as gently as I could to see what he'd do and he shoved me back into our sharp unfinished wood stairs, then when I stood up he grabbed me by the throat and threw me back again, leaving me with blood pouring down my face like someone started a faucet. The last thing I remember him saying to me in that house, after that, was that he was still mad at me\n\nI spent the rest of my time there consoling our disabled mother who watched and having my (other) older sibling help super glue my head because nobody else wanted me to go to the hospital\n\nTold my friend what happened over the phone and him and his dad came to pick me up, told me they didn't feel safe taking me back there, took me to the doctor themselves and since then I've only been back to my old house once to try and get my id and birth records and stuff but I couldn't find it so I'm probably going to have to go back soon -- ofc when I went and told my dad in person then how much the situation fucked me up and that I've not been the same since he rolled his eyes and tried to tell me that John didnt mean to so it didnt matter but not to worry because he wasnt picking sides\n\nMy dad hasn't texted me one single time since this unfolded in march, neither has the douche who assaulted me or his girlfriend honestly thank god\n\nUnfortunately the only one I'm really still in contact with due to this is my mother who is declining in cognitive ability rapidly and im sort of mortified I cant come see her at all because her caretaker is my abuser and I've tried desperately to tell her as much but most recently she's mentioned my upcoming birthday and used the fact I don't feel comfortable spending it with \"family\" to say that I've cut them off and quite honestly I just don't know what else I could do, what to say, this is insane. I don't want to have to skip my mom's funeral because she is surrounded by people who hurt me against her will\n\nI never thought this would be my life and i feel stupid because there are several people in that house, three of which literally witnessed what happened, and yet the dick that assaulted me has apparently been insisting that I \"\"threw myself by the head\"\" despite the fact the doctor described to me how I was scarred cracking it backward by outside force and I left with physical assault documented on my chart but still pretty much everyone at that house has essentially said I've blown this out of proportion and I can't help but feel like maybe they're right even though every person ive talked to outside of this situation has been sort of horrified\n\nShe's said \"everyone regrets it\" and \"it won't happen again\" but my fully able bodied father hasn't had the gall to contact me meaningfully a single time since so I find that hard to believe (picture attached of one of my mother's texts)\n\nCurrently I'm writing this from the safety of my friend's house and we're moving forward but for months I was dealing with daily ptsd episodes and i really just have come out of this different and cautious in a way that everyone there is angry with me for\n\nThis is my first time ever esablishing such a boundary and it really hurts and I cant help but feel like im fucking up horribly by being so firm but I know what happened and it makes me feel insane running in circles with them trying to tell me it isn't so bad without hearing a single word from me\n\nAny thoughts or anything would be appreciated I just want to try and ease my subconscious before the month of my birthday because otherwise I've been stewing in this mostly by myself and wondering if I should bite the bullet and deal with spending my birthday likely being coerced into silence just to see my mom again and try to maybe make one more happy memory with her so the last one I have isn't all this y'know?\n\nEven if nothing comes of this it feels good to have spoken into the void, if anyone's read this far I really appreciate it\n\nLet's hope everyone has a brighter tomorrow\n\n",

        "Background": "Hey all. First time poster here.\n\nSo, the store I work at has an owner (we will call him K) with a serious, serious temper. Most days hes fine and even OVERLY nice, but theres been a few times Ive seen it, and it's explosive.\n\nA previous example: One time an employee called off with short notice for a grocery shift. I literally heard him SCREAMING AND SWEARING across the entire store, before he came to my office and asked me to call someone in. When I called this person, the number was not in service. So, already knowing it wasn't going to be good, I let K know that I couldn't get a hold of who he asked me to.\n\nUpon hearing this, he SLAMMED the pallet of bread he was holding down, screamed \"FUCK\", along with other profanity, then proceeded to throw two entire packages of bagels full force. One soared across the store, the other slammed on a freezer door, LOUD. I skulked away pretty quickly saying ill keep trying to find someone, and by the end of the day he was all sunshine and rainbows again. No apology or acknowledgement of his outburst.\n\nSo the latest situation, and the one that I'm referring here, is recently he PUNCHED A HOLE IN THE BACK OFFICE WALL. Like, you can see clearly where his knuckles punctured through the drywall.\n\nWhen I came into work and saw this, I snapped a quick photo, and sent it to our \"front end girls\" group chat, which consists of all the young women who work with me. The reason I did this is because this kind of behavior is fucking scary, and usually doesn't just stop. I also know that others like myself have grown up in abusive environments, so even just hearing about this can make someone feel unsafe - which is why they should have a RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN IT OCCURS.\n\nAlong with this photo, I said something along the lines of \"when people tell you that K has a temper, this is what they mean. Please remember that a man who has so little control over his own anger at work like this, cannot be fully trusted with your safety. I want everyone to be aware of this behavior just so you can be safe and have the heads up you might need.\"\n\nNow, this is where the issue starts. This made it's way out of the chat and to our head office, which in my opinion, it actually should. But my manager, A, told me that she was dissapointed in me for sharing that picture to the other young women, and that \"things that happen in the store need to stay in the store\". She also said that the day it happened, K felt really shitty about it. (Okay?? So don't do it you manchild)\n\nIn the moment when she sat down with me, I was so flustered and embarrased about the whole thing, I just agreed that I made a bad judgement and apologized, but the more I think about it, the less in the wrong I feel. There's no reason to protect a wall hole puncher, and if it got to HR and A needs to break that news to K about his bad behavior at work....Well, K should find a better way to outlet anger, or reconsider owning a buisness.\n\nI'm absolutely willing to take responsibility for sending the photo to the group chat, and stand by that decision. I would understand being in trouble if I had a photo of say, sensitive documents, but it's K's scary ass actions AT WORK that led me to want to specifically warn the other female staff about this pattern. And If this got out to HR and he's not happy, I feel like A should have my back about it, not put me directly in the line of fire. I wasnt the one who punched the wall, but right now she's planning on basically telling K it's my photo that was shared, and my fault this situation got out of hand and made its way up the chain.\n\nAm I overreacting for thinking this is insane??!?",

        "Background": "A woman moved into a rental house down the street from where I live in February.\n\nAbout a month after moving in two other people also moved in. One of them has a dog and the landlord didn\u2019t want to rent to anyone with pets but they talked him into letting them keep it but they had to keep it outside.\n\nSo they put up a small kennel type fence and also had to chain him in. \nBecause he has some pit in him the landlord required it for liability reasons.\n \nDay after day I walk past him and noticed that nobody ever walks him or plays with him. He is just sitting behind this house being ignored.\n\nWell his owner died about a month later and the poor dog is still just left outside day after day. \nI noticed that he wasn\u2019t being fed and that his water bowl wasn\u2019t very clean. I think if we hadn\u2019t been getting so much rain here that he would probably not have had any water.\n\nI called our animal control department and asked if they would do a wellness check on him. Because of the way he looked and the condition of his cage.\n\nAn officer went by and said he thought the animal was friendly and really didn\u2019t see much to be concerned about. He said he had a dog and said that everyone doesn\u2019t care for their dogs with the same care as others might.\n\nSo I kept walking by checking on him every day and noticed that he was getting a little skinny and that his water bowl was pretty nasty.\nThe weather was starting to get pretty hot and humid and I was worried about him being left outside all day and night. I thought our town had passed a law that said you couldn\u2019t leave your dog outside past a certain amount of time due to extreme heat or cold.\n\nSo I called animal control to see if they could do another check but never heard back from them.\n\nI waited another couple of weeks and when the people living in the house were gone I went over to really get a good look at the dog. I was really worried about him because we were having some extremely hot humid days and a lot of rain and storms.\n\nI started crying when I walked up to the cage. The stench coming from it was horrific. There were flies everywhere. The blanket in his house was wet and moldy. There was a bowl of kitchen slop crawling with flies sitting in front of his house. His water bowl was turning green. The poor dog was just sitting in a corner of his cage in a little mud hole. \n\nHe didn\u2019t even get up when I walked over to him and I hadn\u2019t heard him barking for a couple of days. \nI noticed that you could see his ribs starting to stick out , I hadn\u2019t noticed before because of the way his fur looked. But being up close really taking a good look it was really looking bad.\n\nI went home and got a little bit of food for him and when I came back he finally stood up and I could see just how skinny he was. \nI called animal control again to come out and do a wellness check explaining why I was so concerned.\nThat same officer did go by the house and he said that the dog seemed happy but he didn\u2019t see a problem!! \n\nI am so very upset and want something done for this poor dog.  But I feel like I am overreacting because this officer is saying he doesn\u2019t see a problem! What do you all see and think when you look at this dog?",

I haven\u2019t had any people (maintenance or otherwise) over for about a month and a half, and I haven\u2019t been able to walk recently so I\u2019ve been home 99 percent of that time. The spot I found this in is somewhere I\u2019d look maybe once every three days or so, and I just saw it today. The only way I can feasibly picture it getting in to my apartment is if someone somehow came in WHILE I WAS SLEEPING. This apartment has been giving me the creeps for the longest time, (random doors will be open when I come home, noises at night in other rooms) but I always assumed it was just my imagination. I\u2019m going to be upgrading my locks and getting cameras now, but I would really appreciate if anyone has any idea of how else this could have gotten in my apartment while I am here so often. Thank you!! \ud83d\ude4f ",

I do not try to control her, in fact I encourage her to go out all the time. I was just curious about who she's going with. My thought process is if she is hanging out with this guy, (let's call him dickhead), if she is hanging out with dickhead then she knows I won't like it and that's why she is refusing to tell me.

I\u2019ve been expanding much quicker than expected, so I began seeking an employee. I found a lovely young lady who seemed like an amazing candidate as she had a lot of skills and experience I was looking for. \n\nHer first day was June 12th. Fast forward to now. \nShe has called out a few times in less than a month. \n\nThe first incident she was feeling sick and left early, and couldn\u2019t come in the next day. This I completely understand, I will never have a sick person working near my patients or in the facility due to spread risk. \n\nThe second time she called out because of her dog\u2014 I attached the messages below because it\u2019s too long to explain. \n\nNow, she was scheduled to work this week except Wednesday. She called out on Monday due to being ill. Completely understandable. I\u2019ll attach those messages as well because it\u2019s too long to explain. \n\nI just need advice. Again, it\u2019s only been a month and I\u2019m concerned it\u2019ll become an issue. \n\n*Also, just for background, she\u2019s a part timer earning $25/hr plus I give her the company card for all and any lunch she needs. She gets a 2hr break every shift. I also recently paid for her training because she was interested in doing spray tanning. I told her I\u2019d paid for her education if she was able to reflect the knowledge and skills well on the clients. I proposed 40% commission for every person she does on top of the $25/hr. \n\nSo, should I send the message in the last image?

My doctor told me the baby could come early, so I\u2019m potentially days or weeks away from meet our little one!\n\nIt\u2019s our first baby and I\u2019m excited but also nervous about giving birth. I\u2019ve done everything I can to avoid being sick while giving birth. Got my shots, and both me and my husband wore masks and frequently washed hands at all large family gatherings (so far just on husbands side). It\u2019s been annoying to wear one for hours and hours at family events where we\u2019re also eating and drinking, but his family has been nothing but understanding and supportive, knowing I could pop any day. \n\nWe had planned a belated Christmas with my side of the family this weekend. For context, I live about 2 hours from them.\n\nMy dad spent the day babysitting at my sisters house on Friday, then both my parents came to my house as planned on Friday night. Before they got here, I called to check in and told them again how we\u2019ve been being extra careful, and asked if they think they might be sick or around sick people. They adamantly said no they were fine. \n\nWhen they came over, my dad kept sneezing and coughing. I asked again if he was sick. He again adamantly denied and started raising his voice at me, telling me I\u2019m being ridiculous. I told him I\u2019m going to wear a mask just in case anyway. He would not wear one, nor would he move from where he was next to me on the couch. I got up myself and grabbed a chair and sat several feet away. They were only in the house with us for about an hour, then we went to dinner with one of their friends, where none of us wore masks. We then went home and they slept at a friends house, as planned ( we don\u2019t have any extra bedrooms). \n\nSaturday morning, we were planning to meet with them around noon. I was texting my mom when I should plan on loading up Christmas dinner to bring over to them (and my sister who was also planning to come), and she ignored my question. She then just replied asking me to buy them coffee beans. hours later in a group chat with my sister, she texted me when am I coming over. \n\nBefore we headed over, my sister called me that she was on the way. She seemed really stressed and I asked why. She said something has been going around at the hospital she works at and she\u2019s been sick for days, and it spread to her infant, who my dad was babysitting yesterday. She didn\u2019t want to come because she was worried about getting others sick (especially me), but my parents were pressuring her to come. I asked if my dad knew she and the baby, who he was just with yesterday, we\u2019re sick. She said yes of course. I was furious. He told me so many times there was no way he was sick and wasn\u2019t around anyone who was. He knowingly lied. \n\nI called my parents and told them I knew my sister and her baby are sick and I\u2019m not coming. And also that I shouldn\u2019t have been with them yesterday since my dad was clearly exposed to whatever they have. I told them I had Christmas dinner in the car and would leave it and the Christmas presents on the porch, and asked they leave anything they wanted to give me outside for a contactless swap. \n\nThey said nothing in response to them intentionally exposing me, and just responded that they didn\u2019t feel \u2018safe\u2019 leaving presents outside. I told them please just don\u2019t fight me on this. They were annoyed and just said ok. I got there and there\u2019s nothing outside. They insist we come in the house to get the gifts.

        "Background": "Hello and thanks for reading,\n\nMy girlfriend (19F) and I (20M) have been together for 2 years, since our senior year of high school. She recently joined the Navy and graduated from boot camp about a month ago, and I was finally able to talk to her again after not being able to for 4 months. To my surprise, she was not the same person I knew before boot camp. She became kind of rude and would constantly gossip about people from boot camp with her friends that she made there. She kept mentioning this one guy that was in her class that she considered her friend, but was always flirting with her. Let\u2019s call him \u201cG\u201d, as seen in the screenshots. She told me that one time while she was on the phone with her mom, he went up behind her and told her mom that he\u2019s a really smart and good looking guy, and that she should let him date her. I told her that he probably doesn\u2019t want to be your friend, he wants something more than that. She brushed it off and said that\u2019s just how he is.\n\nOne day while we were on FaceTime, she was sharing her screen to show me some videos on Instagram when one of her friends DM'ed her. She opened it and I quickly screenshotted it, I don\u2019t know what compelled me to but I did it. I looked at it later and it made my stomach drop. The next day, I called my girlfriend and asked her who \u201cH\u201d was. At first she said don\u2019t worry about it, and asked how I know who that is. I admitted to her that I saw her DM with her friend and asked why would she say that she has \u201canother boo\u201d. She said he\u2019s just another friend and that it\u2019s all jokes, that\u2019s just how everyone is in boot camp. I really found this hard to believe, so I decided to go ahead and DM her friend.\n\nWhen I first DM'ed her friend asking if my girlfriend was cheating on me, she immediately snitched to my girlfriend. My girlfriend quickly called me and called me a psychopath and insane for doing that. All I said was that she wasn\u2019t giving me a straight answer, so I had to do it. She hung up and wouldn\u2019t answer any calls. After continuing to pressure her friend and guilt tripping her for a few days, she finally told me what was going on (2nd screenshot). I called my girlfriend and told her what her friend told me, and she started screaming, calling me crazy once again for DM'ing her friend. She also said that her friend was lying. I asked why would she lie, and she said she doesn\u2019t know. Then she switched up the story and said that her friend might have taken her interactions with \u201cH\u201d and \u201cG\u201d in the wrong way. She promised that she was only friends with them, but if it made me happy she would stop talking to them. I just told her to let me think about it and it\u2019s been 6 days since we last talked now.\n\nWas DM'ing her friend really a crazy thing to do?

        "Background": "TW: Subject covers mental illness, has lighting behavior and multiple forms of abuse. \n\nText is a Google transcription of a 3 minute voicemail my mother left me last week.\n\nI (35 afab) marked my mom's (70+ f) phone number as spam bc blocking it didn't keep her from being able to call me for whatever reason. My spouse (39 amab) supports me decision and is encouraging me to keep my distance. \n\nBut, whether bc I've trauma bonded or something, I feel like an ass of a daughter bc she's having health problems as she's getting older and my sister (48 f) keeps insisting we should make up.\n\nSo my mom has always had mental health problems and has always refused to do much more than go to a therapist for a few months, proclaim they're out to get her and then drop therapy. I had several conversations with her about it and she always insisted that she just \"lacked tact\" so people didn't \"want to hear what [she] had to say. \n\nStuff like \"your just lazy. I hate lazy people\" and \"that's not proper! You're a lady, if you do stuff like that people will think you're a wh*re\" and \"her parents didn't raise her right! Poor thing doesn't even have table manors!\". And that's to strangers, co workers, friends, family and every one of those she's said to me (the last one about a friend who put her elbows on the table AT MCDONALD'S when she was eating and def within earshot). So when I was older I saw it for what it was: mental illness with a huge helping of verbal and psychological ab*se.\n\nI grew up with her accusing me of doing things to get her fired or get her passed over for a job. She physically ab*sed me as a toddler and only stopped when my dad threatened to take me away. \n\nShe was constantly making my dad sign these hand written notes that he wouldn't take off with me every time we went on vacation for a weekend get away and required him to have meetings with all 3 of us if he took me out of state for any reason. \n\nShe'd done so much to hurt me over the years and it shows. I'm on anti depressants and anti anxiety meds. I have literal \"stress dreams\" with her in them. There nightmares but without the fearing for my life factor. \n\nA few years ago, just after covid hit and the world shut down, my mother in law, to help a friend in Florida with their health, left for a month. We were living with my mom at the time bc it was preferable to being homeless. But my MIL asked US to house sit. We really agreed since my mom was already driving us nuts. \n\nI asked my mom if she'd watch my cats food and water dishes and just let us know if they needed to be refilled or the cat litter changed while we were gone and we'd stop by and do what needed to be done. She seemed fine with it. I don't remember her getting upset over it. \n\nBut within 24 hours of us being gone she was already upset. Asking where we'd gone (even though If told her previously) and demanding when we'd be back bc even though she \"loved\" animals, I should be at least paying her to watch them if I want going to take care of them. \n\nI calmed her down but it happened again 3 days later. After a week of us driving nearly 60 miles every day to check on the cats per my mother's demands, she texted me again and demanded I apologize for something I'd don't to upset her. \n\nIt was something about still being at my MIL's house and making my mom feel like I hated her because I wouldn't just come home. I told her that I didn't love my MIL more but that I'd made a commitment and I needed to abide by it just like she should as she said she'd watch my fur babies. She then told me I could at least apologize for leaving without telling her I was leaving before hand (which we'd discussed it and she had acknowledged and agreed to watch the cats at the time) because I was acting very \"ungrateful\" for her help. I (having recently learned boundaries) told her, again, that we had talked and that no, I wasn't going to apologize for something I didn't do.\n\nShe went nuclear. She sent Long rambling text messages. Threatening to throw my cats (my fur babies!) outside since I clearly don't love them and when I told her to not threaten my children she said that my spouse and I could just \"get out\" because we were no longer welcome in her home bc we were ungrateful. \n\nI'm the middle of covid. My mother. Locked me out, knowing I had no place to go.\n\nOver 5 years later I've talked to her a have full of times. And only because she covered me at a family gathering at my sister's where I couldn't just tell her to leave me alone. \n\nI've healed a bit since then with intense therapy but I'm no where near able to think about having any kind of healthy relationship with her considering that my sister explained why I was mad to her and she has since repeatedly said \"I don't know why you're mad at me\" followed by her berating me and a lot of \"I might \ud83d\udc80 tomorrow\" kind of stuff. \n\nSo every time I see her name pop up in a call I want so badly to talk to the mom that sat with me when we first moved into a new apartment and the power wasn't on so we cooked with candles and pizza. I want to answer and talk to the mom that told me stories about raising baby possums. \n\nBut I know if I take that chance, eventually I'll get the mom that never tried to change her ways. The mom who called me lazy for not wanting to go out in freezing weather with wet hair to clean her mom's car out. The mom who threw her daughter out of the house in the middle of a pandemic bc she couldn't be gas lit into an apology. \n\nSo I wanted to remove that temptation and marked her number as spam. \n\nAm I overreacting? Should I unmark it as spam? Should I actively consider attempting to see her outside of family gatherings? If only just to give my sister a break?",

I just bruise easily, like a bad apple lol. I\u2019ve been this way since I was a kid. I basically bruise if you look at me wrong \ud83e\udd23 this set of bruises came from me scratching my leg too much, but it happens all over my body. Usually the legs are the worst though. \n\nHere is my question: if I was wearing shorts or a short dress and you saw my bruises, would you think anything of it?\n\nIt\u2019s hot AF where I live and I want to feel cute and wear weather appropriate clothing, but I feel like I always have to cover my legs because of the bruising. I resort to wearing jeans in 100+F weather. \n\nAIO? Would anyone really judge me for this? I also cover up out of protection for my bf. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to think that he did this to me or something. He\u2019s the love of my life and would never hurt me! So I don\u2019t want him being wrongly judged either. \n\nAm I overthinking this? Should I just wear what I want and not give a damn what people think?",

My brother then says \u201cthere should be more r**e jokes\u201d. And that\u2019s where I lose my temper. I tell them they\u2019re disgusting and should be ashamed of themselves. I also tell my brother that as he has a daughter he shouldn\u2019t be making such jokes about that. I leave upset. Later I get some messages from brother. He\u2019s obviously annoyed and now I\u2019m wondering if I should have just let it slide. I didn\u2019t reply I\u2019ve blocked him because he\u2019s been drinking and I don\u2019t want to escalate anything. I feel a bit gaslit like it\u2019s being flipped on me for pointing out he has a young daughter. \n\nAm I too sensitive??",

She gave me the address and I told her 15 min at most.\n\nDriving in the city we are in during bad weather is really hazardous because of the aggressive behaviors, roads are in bad condition, etc. My friend knows this because I've given her rides before. She knows I don't really look at my phone while I drive and I usually try to pull over if I have to fiddle with the GPS. She herself doesn't own a car but knows how to drive.\n\nSo I go to pick her up and I notice she switched locations. States it's just 2 min walking distance, fine, I pull over to loom at the map and I figure I could just keep going where I was heading because it was indeed right around the corner.\n\nThen I arrive and she says she went somewhere else. I find this really rude and inconsiderate, call her out om it. She has told me before I can be blunt with her if she is behaving like this. Well, I guess that was a lie. I have no idea where the Ulta is and given it was in a congested, pedestrian heavy area and about to rain, I was frustrated because those factors make renavigating difficult. I felt she should've helped me help her by staying in one spot instead of flitting between places I have to now figure out how to navigate to. After all, I was kind enough to offer a ride.\n\nThis also isn't the first time she has done something like this. One time she asked me to pick her up on a side street while she was actively walking with someone. I was peeved then - like how am I supposed to find you while you're moving??? - but I kept my mouth shut. But that plus this is why I felt compelled to speak up this time.\n\nI do feel my response was measured and that her behavior, no matter how you spin it, was rude, as is her response. It's been a week and no reply from her, nothing. I find it silly to end a friendship over such a thing, but I also don't want to reach back out because I believe she needs to apologize and if I reach out I'm implying she did no wrong (which could be a construction my brain made up for me). I don't want this friendship to fizz out like this. AIO? Idk how to even proceed, or if I should even keep her as a friend if this is her true self.

Recently we've been having conversations about breaking up because our lives are going down very different paths and we were much more similar when we first started dating. He's very anti breakup and I think it's mostly because he doesn't think he'd be able to get another girlfriend, (he said he didnt want to break up because didn't think anyone else would fuck him because his 'dick is weird' which was super disrespectful but that's for a different post- he has pretty severe phimosis if ur curious)\n\nI've had conversations with him in the past about not following OF models on instagram because frankly I feel there's no need and it makes me kind of insecure. He follows a huge amount of people on instagram so I told him it wasn't necessary to go through all of them and unfollow the models but that he should unfollow them as they show up on his feed and not follow anyone new. We had talked about this at least 4 times.\n\nI learned recently that instagram has changed it to make a person's following be in chronological order, so I checked his and he'd followed on that same day not only a girls main account, but also her backup. Honestly it seemed more disrespectful that he followed both. I casually brought it up being like 'oh are you still unfollowing the OF girls' and he assured me he was. I showed him the screenshot of him following that girl and told him we should break up. \n\nHe seems to think it is no big deal and doesn't think it's worthy of a breakup. Can someone please tell me I'm not being crazy??",

        "Background": "My (17FTM) friend (17NB) has been displaying a really outrageous behavior to me and in general. Recently, the things that they have done has included my boyfriend(18) unfortunately, they would consistently tell my boyfriend that we were gay, which considering past things they\u2019ve done, seems to be a derogatory remark. Which later changed to a joke about my boyfriend being a pedophile because he liked a baby photo of me (I was an extremely tiny baby, by 2 I was barely a foot). Considering my boyfriend was uncomfortable with how they acted, he had nicely approached them and asked them to stop, which resulted in extremely rude answers. They later apologized, but only because I had mentioned to them that I thought it was rude with how they handled that situation, which was 4-5 days later.\n\nAn even more recent issue was their mentions on traumatic experiences. I totally understand that physical and emotional trauma is different, and how online trauma is much more difficult to understand, but considering they\u2019re in a group of people who have been emotionally affected by that kind of stuff. Our other friend, who I\u2019ll name Kevin, has experienced a lot of the gore aspect of the internet, which has wildly affected them. Any kind of gore you can name and they\u2019ve seen it. Which has made them really depressive, emotional, and sensitive to that topic. I personally had many online friendships where I had been emotionally abused, bullied, and sexually affected just by 10-11. But what they have said about digital trauma really felt hurtful considering they know all of this. I totally understand the first half, like why would others want others traumatized? But how they said \u201cif you want to make trauma cool, actually get traumatized\u201d. Which makes me feel like my issues were never real, and I really think that way a lot sometimes too.\n\nAn older issue was how they talked about trans women and lesbians because they were fixated on a trans woman lesbian relationship, and they were tired of drawing them. But, who just says that they wish they were homophobic, in a group of gay and trans people, a friend group of all places. They constantly call one of our other friends, who I\u2019ll call Bee, a lesbian as a joke when they always say they\u2019re not comfortable with being called that because that\u2019s not what she is. She identifies as a bisexual woman. This had affected her as shown above. \n\nI think another issue may be how they joked about hating my boyfriend for 3 years. They originally said that it was from boredom, which they had clarified was only a joke and everyone else knew it was a joke (they did not). I had to keep my boyfriend away from my whole friend group because of it. I didn\u2019t want either of them to be upset, but unfortunately it caused my boyfriend to think all of my friends hated him. I feel really guilty about leaving my boyfriend out and I\u2019m absolutely devastated over it, but I\u2019m holding a bit of a grudge towards them. But even more unfortunately, they have also said that they then lied about doing it out of boredom, and have stated they didn\u2019t know why. \n\nThere\u2019s been many things like this as well, where they said my recently passed rabbit was \u201cjust a pet\u201d, where they\u2019d rant and vent in channels that weren\u2019t meant for that to the public of our group. And being pissed I had ignored them for 2 hours for the confession they said about my boyfriend. \n\nI\u2019m worried I\u2019m being overdramatic, and I\u2019m just really overall upset about their behavior to me and my loved ones considering I know I have emotional issues and I\u2019m not sure how to go through with it.

Our grandmother has demtia and she lives with us. We take turns taking care of her in the morning but typically the care of her falls mostly to me amd my mom whole she's at work. I also take care of most of the chores along with cooking dinner for everyone almost every night. We share a room so to keep us both happy and so we both have pur privacy every week on the days she's home we switch who has to be in the living room for the day instead (we both still sleep in the room, it's just for during the day). I had spent almost three weeks being the one in the room, I assumed it was because sje didn't feel like moving her stuff as she had said that once when i brought it up and hadn't complained. If she wasn't going to be in the room anyway, i didn't see any reason for me to sit out in the living room. There was an arguement, she brought it up and I attepted to clear up the misunderstanding and told her if she wanted to be in the room she only need to say so. The past three weeks she's been in the room. This couldn't have neen a misunderstanding as I don't have stuff to move around. I brought it up to her on Sunday, telling her it had been two weeks and it was her week to be in the living room. I got angry and she refused to see anything from my perspective. I went to the living room and she bribed me with candy so I'd forgive her i suppose (she used to bride me all the time in the past as well). She was in the room both sunday and Monday turning it into three weeks. This past Sunday was her birthday and I made dinner (along with homemade garlic bread, not the bread part, which I had never attempted before), I also made her a cake, a box mix since we didn't have the ingredients and we haven't had much money this week. I asked her to empty the dishwasher this morning so that we actually had plates for dinner, she forget and went to work after I reminded her twice and she cut me off. I ended up having to empty and fill it myself despite doing so many times before. In the past I have done so much of her chores for nothing in return and she used to .take me do a bunch of things for her like fetching her a water or making her breakfast, things I have heartily refused now because I'm tired of being her gopher. Mom has told me to stop being so nice to her cause I try to give her the benefit of the doubt and end up doing the stuff she forgets to or refuses to. Even my mom is tired of her cause she barely does anything around the house, spends money and is constantly lying to her to the point where she can't trust a word she says anymore.

You act like you are soooooo perfect and all high and mighty. Your not. You forget shit. Thats always your excuse when you don't do your homework isn't it? So stop acting like your perfect. You're bringing schoolwork into a dissolution of household chores? I make sure I take care of what mom asks of me, either right when she does or when I remember. The reason I am upset is because I reminded you twice and you got so upset you didn't let me get past don't forget the second time. It should have been done either earlier that morning or once you were done eating especially since you know you are also prone to forgetting chores. When you remember something it should be taken care of.

I don't always have the luxury to leave it to you to take care of on your own time.

My sister\u2019s a sweet kid, so she wouldn\u2019t be likely to sneak off and party around town. Besides, our town is really small and there\u2019s not much of anything to do around us. I was a little worried when she wouldn\u2019t let me talk to her, but I didn\u2019t really think that much of it until yesterday.\nI got a text from my sister\u2019s friend yesterday afternoon (other two screenshots). My mom grounded me for every little thing when I lived there, so it\u2019s not crazy that she\u2019d do that to my sister after I left. I sent the screenshots to my boyfriend after I got them to get his opinion. He was worried and offered to come down with me in case my mom got violent or anything like that, which she has in the past. He wound up coming with me. After we got there, I went to unlock the door with my key and it had been chaged. I could hear my mom screaming and yelling at my sister from outside. My boyfriend called the cops while I went around the house to try and open the back door or one of the windows in the bedrooms. I made it in maybe five minutes before the cops came and I\u2019m glad I did. My mom was completely wasted and all up in my sister\u2019s face. I stepped in and pushed her back some. She was pissed and started hitting me and trying to get to my sister. The cops arrived and were able to get in. They arrested my mom and wound up needing to send her a few hours away for a psych hold because she was trying to do things to harm herself. I\u2019m assuming my mom called my uncle, her brother, today because I\u2019ve been getting a lot of calls and texts from her side of the family asking why I sent her away and that I was a bitch and overreacting. I know that was the best option, especially for my sister\u2019s sake, but everyone is saying otherwise. I plan on staying here for a little so I know my sister\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t really want to leave her in the care of my mom. My grandparents (dad\u2019s side) are planning to go to court so they can take custody of her so she won\u2019t have to stay with my mom. At the time of posting this, I\u2019m still at home with my sister. She\u2019s okay, a little shaken up, but she\u2019s not hurt. I may come back to update this if anything major happens, but I\u2019m unsure.",

Me(29F) and my husband(28M) have been together for 5 years (on the 13th of this month) and he recently started a EMT program that is 7 females and him and one other married man. They are finishing up week THREE today. He signed a 2 year contract and if he doesn't fulfill it he will owe $5000+.\nThere had been some comments here and there that made me uncomfortable enough to talk about boundaries with him, as we have never had any type of issue like this over our relationship. Hand to God, never felt an inkling of jealousy or ever felt like I needed to worry. In fact I used to brag about how he would never do anything like that. \n\nWell. Then the other day we had an argument and I had a pit in my stomach. For the first time in 5 years I checked his texts. And I found a link to this d!ld0. I was seething and the next morning I mentioned it to him and he tried to say that he ignored it and thought that was setting a boundary. I was so mad that on my way to work I told him to text in the group as me saying it was inappropriate. So he did and proceeded to send me these screenshots after. \nHis explanation was that these girls were sitting in a group talking about how inadequate their men are and how they need help to please a woman and the one who sent it pointed out the two men in class and said \"if you really want to please your woman use this\" and my husband said the other guy made a joke but that he just ignored them. He sent me these screenshots and I was disgusted that he apologized for setting a boundary?? And that the girls all blew it off like it was nothing. \n\nWell, a friend of mine's Mom works as dispatch at the same ambulance district. She asked me what was going on because I guess rumors are already going around there about it. But they heard a different story. Don't know all the details there but enough to where my friend told her Mom \"I don't see him doing that. I know him and what he's like\" \n\nWell. After she told me that, I went back to his messages. His deleted messages. And I'll put the ones he made sure to lie about and omit. You'll be able to tell the difference.\nEven after we had a 3 hour conversation about boundaries, why I found this disrespectful, etc. Where he promised me that I didn't have to worry about him lying, hiding things, etc. I asked him to just be open and honest so I don't find things and it's sneaky. \n\nThat was his chance to come clean about the deleted messages. But he didn't. \nI saw them and woke him up. \nI found out that when they addressed him in person it wasn't the other man who made a joke, it was HIM. He told them \"I don't have that issue\" in regards to using dildos to please a woman. \n\nFor the record, my \"previous relationship\" he's referring to was my last serious relationship almost 10 years ago, where for years I was being gaslit and told our female roommate and him were just friends and when we broke up he joined her relationship and became a throuple.\n\n\nHe has recently lost 60 lbs and feeling confident which is great, but this is absolutely not okay to me. How do I trust his word moving forward?? To me this is the group testing what they can/can't say and he allowed- even encouraged them to open this door. Am I overreacting?? \nPlease give me your opinions because I have never felt this way with him and I am seriously on the considering my options over this because if I can't trust you, especially after all this time, what's the fucking point??? \n ",

His father has completely ruined any type of a relationship with us as this is the last straw\u2026.and his mother\u2019s complete silence has put her in the same boat as his father. Am I over reacting? Should I confront it or just let it go? ",

        "Background": "I (28f) baked some blueberry muffins today and left them to cool on the bench. Recipe says it would make 12 regular sized muffins but in reality I got 9 tiny muffins, small cupcake sized. I ate one then went to my room waiting for them to cool down and my flatmate (30f) comes downstairs and asked if she can have one. I tell her they\u2019re not that great as they didn\u2019t rise enough and the recipe made less than intended, but she can have one. \n\nI came out from my room later on to see she had taken 2 muffins - the largest ones - leaving me with 6 tiny muffins left. I was pretty annoyed since it took me over an hour to make them and I wanted them to last the whole week as I\u2019m not doing well financially right now and need to make what I have last until my next pay. For context, I do like to share and regularly offer my flatmates little bits of whatever I am making, usually some cut fruit or snacks. However this flatmate does tend to ask me 1-2 times a week if I have any snacks (outside of what I offer) while earning more than 2-3x my income, which adds to the annoyance. So I admit I could have sounded less pissed off in my text but I was already in a bad mood and this took the cake (technically, muffin). \n\nMore context, she wanted to go on an elimination diet and doesn\u2019t like cooking/ prep work, I used to be a professional chef and she asked me multiple times over several weeks if I could cook for her and she\u2019d pay me, so I did, for 2 weeks. That\u2019s what she\u2019s referring to when she said she hired me. \n\nAnyway, I am quite upset over her response and think she was quite rude especially bringing up the fact that she \u2018hired me\u2019 as she still owes me the money for the work I did for her. I think it comes off as manipulative and almost threatening. So am I overreacting or is she overreacting? ",

She asks me every couple months if I can dog sit for her and I have said yes every single time including when hurricane Milton hit our town. She went on vacation and I EVACUATED with her 2 dogs. It was very stressful and hard since my family has dogs too and her dogs don\u2019t react well to others. I drove 13 hours with them and kept them safe with me for the duration of the hurricane. She kept promising to send money for a hotel room so I could keep them separate and not in a tent but she never did.

Here is some context: I\u2019m a tattoo artist from Los Angeles California, I travel the country doing Tattoo Expos. I attended the Philadelphia Tattoo Expo in January 25th & a woman walked up to my booth looking for a quote on this custom lettering piece she wanted on her arm. I told her I can do it for $300 if she got it done at the expo (we try to keep as busy as we can while at the expos) and she said she would think about it. On the last day if the expo, she came back to my booth and said she was up for it. At this point, I was booked out and unable to fit her in my slots for the day. I told her I could do it for her at a local shop that allowed me to guest spot for a few days, however the price would be increased since it\u2019s no longer being done at the expo and on top of that I would have to pay a percentage of my earnings (per tattoo) to the local shop that\u2019s letting me guest. She was totally down for it. I got her booked up and two days after that, had her come by to the shop. I had a couple technical difficulties with my stencil printer because I have to travel with a portable one that is gimmicky. Not to mention I had to set up my guest station to my liking, to make sure I can work comfortable. Once everything was set, she decided to go bigger than initially quoted her and I let her know it was going add to the cost. She was hyped and didn\u2019t care, immediately agreed. At the end of the session I let her know her total was $490 and she looked a little stunned, mind you, she was fully aware that I flew from the west coast to do this expo and she was aware that the local shop I guested at was a east coast renowned tattoo shop.. so of course I have to give a nice percentage to the shop. Regardless, she paid her balance, I got pictures of the work and she walked off pretty quiet. A couple days ago I messaged her to see if the tattoo held up great and let her know I was gonna be back in town. This is what she messaged me back, not gonna like I felt really sh***y about it. I\u2019m aware this economy is hard on everyone. I\u2019m aware \u201cworth it\u201d to someone may not be \u201cworth it\u201d to another.. I just feel like I gave her a one of a kind experience, took great care of her and executed a phenomenal piece. It sucks to know someone feels like you ripped them off when in reality you are attending a prestigious tattoo expo (that you paid a lot of money to work at) and have a strong portfolio to show for.

        "Background": "2 years ago, my friend \u201cKayla\u201d (F23), hooked me (F24) up with her friend \u201cJake\u201d(M23). She was very involved in this arrangement and spoke very highly of him and how much he was into me. It lasted 2 weeks and fizzled out because I was not interested in pursuing anything further with him. \n\nFast forward to this week, he reaches out to me out of the blue, and asks me out. I did not respond because I am now in a relationship. She texted me last night and told me that \u201cJake\u201d really wants to see me and that he misses me, which is odd because she knows I am in a relationship, so why would she encourage this? \n\nI told some of our mutual friends about this interaction, and they looked confused. They relayed to me that Kayla and Jake had a thing in 2021. They slept together a few times and the last time it happened, she called one of our friends crying, and said he r*ped her. She later downplayed it and said \u201cit wasn\u2019t that bad\u201d\n\nI was obviously very taken aback by all of this new information and decided to call her out on it. I have so many questions still. Why did she lie to me about their history? Why would she continue to push Jake onto me? Why would she even think to set me up with him if he r*ped her? And why was she so invested in us getting together? \n\nI feel like she\u2019s not taking any accountability based on her responses. What do you guys think? ",

Understand wanting to be with your friends again, but they need space and your insistence on being back in despite the bitching is bothering me. This is a topic we'd be waiting at least a month to make a decision on, but you are impatient as ever, insisting you've changed and gotten rid of all your bad habits in just a couple weeks. Amparo would've liked to see you again, if you hadn't been so pushy about this, if you weren't constantly asking about the server, if you hadn't kept asking me how they're doing, making me ask them their own opinions on you while they don't want anything to do with you.

        "Background": "In November 2024, I got my (2) impacted wisdom teeth out after being in pretty much constant excruciating pain.\nImmediately after surgery, I woke up and told my nurse that it felt like there was a piece of my tooth that landed in the back of my throat. She told me I was just feeling weird from the drugs, even though I felt fine, but I trusted her opinion and stopped complaining about the sharp feeling in my throat. A week later, I had my post-op check in and I complained about pain from healing, reporting that I woke up every day since surgery with migraines and jaw pain. I wanted a refill on my medicine but the doctor quickly said no, just take more ibuprofen (even though I explained the amount of ibuprofen he had me taking was hurting my stomach). Roughly a month after surgery, I was still having a considerable amount of pain. I took medicine most days of the week until I just decided to deal with the pain the same way I had before I had surgery. Now we are 4 months post-op, and late last night I was having intense jaw pain and was grinding my teeth as a result. I poked around with my finger, felt what I thought was a popcorn kernel, and ran to my bathroom to try and dislodge it.\nQuickly, my finger wasn't enough and I had to start scraping it with a flosser. My mouth was pouring blood, but l was determined to get the kernel out because of how it was poking my gums. After about 15 minutes of wiggling, I feel relief as I finally am about to grab the foreign object out of my mouth! But instead of a popcorn kernel... it's a piece of tooth from my surgery... that they missed??? I was in such disbelief when I saw the fragment that I thought I was dreaming at first, but no, it's real. I called the office today and they're trying to convince me, it's normal, it happens... but I don't think so. They're also calling it a bone spur but teeth are bones so ??? I'm confused. Do I seek legal help?",

        "Background": "I 28F and my husband 34M have a 6month old daughter.  Yesterday was a tough day.  We came off a weekend where my husband had a lot of work to get done but his back was sore and he was just generally off the whole weekend.  My daughter always struggles to nap on weekends due to her dad being home.  So come Monday I\u2019m physically and emotionally exhausted already but our daughter had her 6 months vaccinations so of course another not great day and come her bedtime of 7pm I am wiped.\n\nI put her to bed as always as she will scream and cry if my husband tries.  This is likely due to being exclusively breastfed.  She has been having some very restless nights in the last few weeks getting up extremely frequently (sometimes every 2 hours all night) as she has learned to roll and gets stuck in her crib.  When I get up with her in the night I am up anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes and then I don\u2019t immediately fall back asleep when I am back in bed.  My husband appreciates that I am tired and doing a majority of the work but I don\u2019t think he truly understands.  \n\nSo last night I told him how tired I was and that I just wanted to go to sleep.  Sometimes I stay up for an hour after our daughter goes to sleep to watch a show or do something I enjoy.  Last night I did not want to do even that.  My husband texted me twice asking for intimacy and I answered according to my mood, it may have come off as harsh.  To be fair to myself I initiated intimacy Saturday evening and it was good as I was in the mood.  It is difficult for me to feel like intimacy since birth as it is painful (more uncomfortable these days as I am more dry but feels like a 2 out of 10 pain wise) and I feel like my breasts are done by the end of the day.  When I got in the bed my husband very obviously wanted something so I offered touching and him to jerk off.  It started fine but he asked two more times for sex which I declined.  Finally after about 20 minutes he finished.  He immediately rolled over and fell asleep.  I was unable to fall asleep, I was a bit upset by how pushy he was and I think that kept me up.  \n\nI finally fell asleep and then shortly awoke to our daughter crying.  As I got up my husband said he felt great after sleeping an hour.  I looked at my phone and I was probably asleep 15-20 minutes.  I got mad and said I just wanted to sleep but he always gets what he wants but I deal with the consequences.  After that I went to settle our baby while he left for hockey.  \n\nThat night I got up every 2 hours.  In the morning I apologized about being angry when I got up the first time.  This devolved into an argument as he told me about wanting to be intimate more frequently but I am often not in the mood.  This is fair as our sex life has taken a dip to maybe twice a week.  I tried to explain that I\u2019m emotionally and physically drained but he wasn\u2019t having it and just wanted to tell me how it hurt him.  I ended up just walking away to change a diaper and crying.  He texted me once he got to work to apologize.  \n\nI could see how maybe my emotions are making me the jerk here but I\u2019m unsure and want other opinions.",

She often drops by unannounced or makes decisions without asking us, and when I try to communicate openly, she tends to take it personally or twist it.\n\nA recent situation tipped things over:  \nWe mentioned we were looking at getting a specific type of shed (a Keter one), but without asking or showing us a link, my mum bought one herself and told me she\u2019d be bringing it up and setting it up on Saturday.\n\nI replied saying I hadn\u2019t seen it, and reminded her we were already looking for a specific kind. She then sent a string of messages (screenshot attached) calling me ungrateful, saying I\u2019ve become a snob, and that they won\u2019t be coming to our home anymore. She also blocked me.\n\nFor context, she often tries to blame my girlfriend for any decision I make, as if I\u2019m not capable of making choices for myself. My girlfriend has never been rude and is always grateful for anything we\u2019re given \u2014 but somehow she always becomes the scapegoat.\n\nI replied politely, telling my mum I appreciated the gesture and that she\u2019s always welcome \u2014 but I\u2019m now left feeling anxious and second-guessing myself.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this isn't even scratching the surface. When we moved house, my mum wasn't best pleased. It's a nice house in a sought after area, but when my mum saw the floorplan and the dimensions of the house, she said to my brother, who told me, that \"you couldn't even swing a cat in it\". God, I'd love to make a thread of all things she's said that have been hurtful over this past year.\n\nOh another one, when I was living with my parents, there was a time when my younger brother's girlfriends dog unexpectedly died. I was sympathetic towards her but because I didn't give her a hug (which wasn't appropriate at the time), my mum flipped because of this and kicked us both out of the house and I stayed in a hotel for a week because I didn't have a place to stay. She didn't invite me back. She packed two suitcases full of my belongings and I had to find a place to live. Me and my girlfriend were doing long distance at the time (approx 2hr drive), and because of work commitments, staying at hers wasn't an option, even though her and her family did offer.\n\nAm I overreacting for being upset by all this? Or is this kind of behaviour not okay?",

        "Background": "Hi all, I'm gonna try and keep this as short as possible and I'll also do a TL;DR, it's also my first time pointing on here but am feeling genuinely conflicted. \n\nSo, I'm (32m) born and raised in NYC. I met a friend (27m) at a bar in 2021 who had just moved to NY so I was around 28/29 when we met and he was 23, he had just moved to NYC literally the week we met and was out solo looking for friends when we met.\n\n I was originally actually on a date with another guy and it was going so horribly, the guy I was with was obnoxiously drunk and drawing attention to us so a couple of times (let's call him H) H looked over looking concerned but almost laughing and we eventually ending up talking when we both went to the bar to get a drink, the guy I was on a date with ending up getting kicked out and I stayed and had some drinks with H. \n\nWe ended up hooking up that night and kept in touch and started hanging out pretty regularly and would hook up but it was always very clear that we were friends with benefits, I would encourage him to explore the city and make new friends or pursue other guys. I definitely took him under my wing and began to see him as a little brother. \n\nAfter being in New York for about six months, he did eventually start making other friends and going on dates which I continued to encourage. We would still hang out, and we would just get drinks and do regular schmegular shit together. \n\nEventually, I started getting messages on dating apps and on Instagram, with people being like \"omg, your friend needs help\" or asking me how I knew him and stuff after seeing photos of us together on Instagram. \n\nNot long after that I ended up finding out that he had been hanging out with some really questionable people and fallen into some pretty serious substance abuse issues. A lot of the people that were messaging me were accusing him of having a severe drug problem, being a complete mess when they hung out and a couple people said that he had stolen things from them or their friends. \n\n(Continued in the comments, mods please pin the comment if you can!)\n\nSo I ended up talking to him about it and he basically got really defensive and was making a bunch of excuses and saying that those people were lying and just like all of the typical things that you would expect when it comes to an addict. It's also something to note that my childhood best friend was also an addict, and I had just previously lost her in 2019 so I was recognizing all the signs and it was triggering to say the least so, I stopped spending as much time with him. \n\nAfter that, it was just more of the same. I was still hearing stories about him from people, and we kind of stopped spending as much time together because of what he was like when he was not sober, it was not fun to be around and genuinely scared me. It had gotten to a point where he had been kicked out and banned from multiple bars.\n\nI ended up getting into a relationship and was not going out as much but every time I saw him, it was kind of because he either had just gotten fired and needed help trying to find a job, or he had just gotten kicked out of his apartment and needed somewhere to stay. But he was just spiraling. He ended up moving back home (in the midwest) and we pretty much lost touch entirely after that (this was the end of 2022, so 3 years ago).\n\nBetween then and now, we're hardly spoke besides him calling me, five times in a row every couple months at 3am, which I wouldn't answer and then he would text me and flip out on me and blow up my phone. \n\n\n\nOne of these times where he called me in the middle of the night flipping out was about a mutual friend of ours that he knew when he was in New York that I had been spending time with. He essentially called me and just accused me of sleeping with him and none of what he was saying was a string of coherent words or would make any sense for him to be upset about even if it was true (H and the guy never dated or hooked up up) So at that point I just lost my patience with him, blew up and we stopped talking altogether after that. \n\nFast forward to now, and it's been three years and we have not had a conversation. I haven't heard from him outside of the odd 3am text every couple of months or so which I don't answer. The only things I know about him now are what I can see on social media, which is that he leaned really hard into the \"addict aesthetic.\" Most of his posts are of him smoking or looking really unwell and unhinged. \n\nNow, all out of the blue, he randomly called me this week when I was at work and I had just gotten a new phone and lost all of my contacts soI texted asking who it was and that was our conversation above. I haven't responded to his last message. I plan to eventually but I can't figure out what to say.\n\nAt this point in my life, I have made the conscious decision to remove myself from situations that are taxing to me. I'm dealing with my own mental health struggles and my own issues and my worry is that I don't have the emotional bandwidth to take on someone else's as much as I want support. \n\nI also find the way that he chose to message me a bit odd. One of the videos that he sent me above was literally him having sex with two other guys while they all smoked meth. Also, for someone that's sober or trying to get sober, to immediately suggest we get drinks when we hang out is kind of a head-scratcher. It's one thing to be self-deprecating, I think that's kind of a coping mechanism a lot of the time but I also think that there is a level of avoidance that comes with that, specifically being that there's still been no accountability taken and we're already making jokes about it. \n\nI'm not saying that he owes me a big grand apology because he doesn't. In fact, I'm not even mad at him. I just don't want to put myself back in an uncomfortable situation that I've successfully removed myself with when there's not a lot of strong evidence pointing to it not happening again.\n\nWhere should I go from here? I definitely want to be a support system for him and I'm really happy that it seems like he is trying to make the right decisions. I just also know what it was like going through it the first time and I really need to protect my peace as well.\n\n**TL;DR: AITO for not calling a friend who reached out to reconnect years later after (kind of) trying to get sober to protect my peace?**",

        "Background": "For context me and this boy been talking for a couple months. He asked me out in the end of January. He started to block me during the day, then add me back at night. And barely text me. Then he called me with his friend and told me we shouldn't date bc he's going through so much. (Mind u this is a week in). We hung out a lot before and after this. At a party I caught him texting his ex in front of me and lying ab it saying it was his sister. And was trying to get with my bsf at the party and told me I'm cock blocking  So I slapped him. He got so mad so we had a talk for 2 hours of him js repeating himself and trying to work things out saying he still needs to talk to his ex bc she helped him through a lot and is the only person who understands him and she ig still has his snowboard. Mind u I put my all in this guy and told him I will always be there for him and try to help him be the best version of himself. He then sent me vids of him s/h himself when he went home and blocked me. With a text saying \"I'm glad I met u but I'm out\" Then he texted me the next day like nothing happend. Then he started to call me again and still acted like nothing happend. One of the calls woke me up from my sleep and he tried accusing of me getting with his friends. Because apparently his friends been trying to hmu. And I guess this one friend in particular asked him if he still likes me. His response was \"he'll no\" I told him im literally not getting with his friend and I don't ever text him. Thennn a couple days ago I was at a party he was supposed to go to, but he has the flu so his friends brough that one friend I was just talking ab. I thought he hated me but he texted me b4 the party started ands said \"u better not get on my friend ****\" I said ok. I wasn't planning on it tbh. All his friends at the party were talking ab my situationship saying fuck him and that I should not be with him and I should get with the other friend. So I did lol. Then he found out the next day while he was ON THE WAY to a frat party. Mind u we were on the phone when he was getting ready to go to the frats, so that means before he knew ab what I did with his friend he was going to the frats regardless. Then on the way he sent me crazy texts calling me names. I told him he hold me a double standard bc he expects me to be loyal when we have no title , even tho he texts his ex and tries to get on my friends. I was also very loyal before everything but I was sick of looking stupid and him just not texting me and me still giving in to everything. I made him speechless. Then at the frats I got sent a pic of him in a girls bed. But I'm not sure if he went there to get with that girl, or only got with that girl bc he found out what I did. Because he did only find out when he was almost at the frats. Well then after all that I got a crazy text from him today asking if we can talk. And the added picture is what he said. From all this context is he manipulating me? Any questions I can answer or give more context if needed this is js a summary. ",

I would try to listen to something and then express my opinion on what he said. It would just devolve into him interrupting me, talking over me, and sometimes him yelling.

        "Background": "This is almost everything my stepmom asked me to do while she and my dad are away on a trip. They left Monday and are supposed to come back Thursday, so I have roughly 3 days to do all of this.\n\nI am really really annoyed at this, although this is nothing new in the slightest. In fact, she usually gives me longer lists for me to complete on weekends. (Daily lists are a lot shorter though as they usually have about 7-10 tasks or about 3-4 on my \u201coff days.\u201d)\n\nI have work every day this week, though granted I do just work at a fast food store. On top of that, I really desperately need to practice and prepare for an upcoming audition (that they know about and are expecting me to make first chair for). Also\u2026 dude\u2026 this is my one and only little half-week that I\u2019ve gotten all summer to just be by myself. I\u2019ve been working both at my job and doing these types of lists all summer nonstop. Have not had a single day where I haven\u2019t had to either complete a chore list or go to work. Next week my family is supposed to go to Michigan (which I\u2019ll be going too), the week after that I\u2019m working, the week after that I have band camp and then the week after that I start college again.\n\nI\u2019m getting really tired of this. It\u2019s like she cannot fathom the idea of me not being useful to her for one fucking day. And I\u2019ve tried communicating my frustrations only to be met with the old classic \u201cwell life is all about hard work blah blah blah we all have to do work\u201d spiel from both my parents. I cannot wait to move out and never have to put up with this shit again. \n\nHowever\u2026 I understand that a good chunk of these tasks are pretty quick. Like I finished putting the metal detector up in a pretty decent amount of time so that wasn\u2019t really that bad. And the ones where I just have to put things away aren\u2019t bad either. So my current concern right now is that I really truly am overreacting to this and that it\u2019s really not that bad of a chore list. Like I\u2019m worried I\u2019m just being really lazy, because honestly yeah I am a lot of the time. I genuinely cannot tell. So any input on this from an outsider/neutral perspective would be great.

        "Background": "My boyfriend (28M) and I (30F) have been dating for 2 years. We don\u2019t live together and we see each other about 2-3 times a week. We\u2019re both not the biggest texters but when I\u2019m in a relationship I do like to send thoughtful texts occasionally, especially if we\u2019re not seeing each other that day. Most of the time we can go the whole day without texting each other, but will have a quick phone call in the evening.  \n\nI have asked a few times in the past if he can just send a quick text (more so to give me a heads up with plans since I\u2019m not as spontaneous as he is) but also to just check-in every once in awhile (I\u2019m not even asking for everyday, but every other day would be nice). His usual reply is that he\u2019s just busy with work or busy with other things. He works from home most days and he\u2019s usually pretty good at texting his family and friends back in a reasonable time. \n\nAnyways, today I sent a reminder text around 1pm to bring his shovel (it\u2019s an inside joke - he bought a shovel keyring for his coworker). They were meant to play in a work-related golf tournament in the afternoon. Didn\u2019t hear from him all day so texted him a casual message around 10pm asking if he picked up my bike. Tried to ring him but he declined my call. \n\nAfter I sent the last message after midnight he finally opened my messages and left me on read. I just wanted to know if he was okay and safe but still no reply. I rang him again and he picked up the phone all casually like nothing was wrong. I asked if he was okay and he said yeah, he just went to get drinks with his coworker after the golf tournament. They teed off at 2.30pm so surely he would\u2019ve had time to just open and like my message between 7pm and midnight? Anyways he said that he can\u2019t be checking his phone every 20 mins. I told him that that\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for - just a simple text to let me know he\u2019s safe after I\u2019ve expressed that I was worried that I didn\u2019t hear from him all day. \n\nJust feeling a bit hurt since this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. It feels like a constant pattern and that I\u2019m not even an afterthought. He makes me feel like I\u2019m asking for too much when I feel like I\u2019m asking for bare minimum communication.

When I first got into college, I got an apartment and my dad would pick me up and drop me off at that apartment every weekend (unless I had finals) FOR TWO YEARS. I was so tired of it. I finally got my own car, filled my schedule to the brim, and got a part time job so I wouldn't have to go back home every. Single. Weekend. Now, I graduated and work a pretty decent job where I can afford a 1b1b apartment by myself. My parents pay half the rent, but FOR my sister, otherwise I could absolutely afford the apartment myself. \n\nMy dad texted me this at work and hasn't responded since then. Im just so beyond angry. I know I'm not over reacting, my friends are telling me that too, but I also know my parents are going to guilt me into thinking I am. I mean by the screenshots, you can already tell my dad is. ",

Response to financial questions in top comment.\n\n-------------------\n\nSo my wife (34F) and I (32M) have been struggling financially since the beginning of this year. Some decisions were made that have put us in a fair bit of debt, and it\u2019s been hard to stay afloat and knock the debt down. \n\nSince February and for the second time ever, I\u2019ve been working two full time remote jobs as a software engineer to make enough to cover our expenses and save / clear debt. Total yearly combined was around $280k before taxes, but when paying down the debts and such we\u2019d often end up nearly net 0 at the end of the month, which was frustrating. I\u2019m not a big spender, but my wife has a bit of a shopping therapy habit. \n\nI was told last Friday the 22nd that the 29th (tomorrow) would be my last for my second job, as the project was ending early and they\u2019d be terminating my contract (unfortunately they have that right). So I\u2019ve been scrambling to find a replacement on such short notice, knowing that my main job barely covers rent and daycare as it is. \n\nRecently, my wife wanted to help out as a short term boost by returning some of her Nordstrom clothing. I was against this (as I always have when she\u2019s suggested it) as I don\u2019t like the idea of her doing that. She\u2019d been replying that it was fine, she didn\u2019t wear those items really ever anyway, and it would help. I believed her, so I acquiesced and dropped it. \n\nNow, I am catching flak day after day for not making enough income to provide my family with the lifestyle they need. The text exchange above happened this evening as I was putting our boys to bed (I am the one to take care of them when they\u2019re home, play with them, bath them, and put them to bed; she struggles with this and doesn\u2019t like to do it). \n\nI get a lot of shit frequently for years that I haven\u2019t bought us a house yet. Even though we\u2019ve lived in the San Jose (house? Yeah right) and Seattle (1.5mil only half as bad as SJ) since 2019. \n\nMy income is always seen as inadequate even when it\u2019s been over 250k, mostly because I don\u2019t work for a company like Google yet and don\u2019t get stock money. It\u2019s frustrating as hell when she knows the situation through and through. \n\nShe\u2019s now pissed at me for using the word \u201cdeceived\u201d, saying she doesn\u2019t deserve to have me say that after all the sacrifices she\u2019s made. \n\nSo I ask, was I wrong to feel deceived when she told me it was fine that she returned the clothes, but then came back and used it against me in this argument?

The screenshot she sent me from her app corroborates that. \n\nIt is now March 5th and she is saying she thinks she is pregnant. She said she wanted to take a pregnancy test just in case. \n\n4:30PM today, She sent me a super blurry picture of a pregnancy test that has a faint positive line in it.. she claims the line was really faint so she had to zoom in on the picture. It looks SO pixelated to me that it looks like she googled a picture and zoomed in on it, however I have not found that picture she used so I can\u2019t confirm that. \n\n9PM today.. she claims she wants to take another one just in case. She sends me a picture of her holding a test in the box. This picture appears to be legit, I do believe she at least purchased the test and has it in her possession. She then sends me a picture of a clearly positive test. This picture is also blurry and pixelated which had me raise my doubts. HOWEVER.. after googling pictures of a clear blue positive test I feel like I found the exact picture that she used, but then zoomed in on it to make it appear original. The background just matches up so perfectly that it just screams fake to me. \n\nI attached the pics of the \u201cfaint positive\u201d test, the \u201cclear positive\u201d test, and the picture I found on Google images.\n\nAIO?

The definition of a furry according to google is \u201can enthusiast for animal characters with human characteristics, in particular a person who dresses up in costume as such a character or uses one as an avatar online.\u201d Some furries see it more as a costume and a way to express their selves and their creativity. Not all furries are \u201csexual deviants\u201d or \u201czoophiles\u201d we are just people who like anthro characters, They have jobs, That\u2019s it, all it is a personal mascot. Some Media outlets will make you believe that furries are out here barking at people or pooping in litter boxes but the truth is usually the people barking are the ones who make fun of us and there is no actual evidence of furries pooping in a litter box. (We use the toilet guys\u2026)\n\nAnyway let\u2019s continue\u2026\n\nI was on Roblox today and was playing a game online. It was a furry server and all I wanted to do was use my free time to play and chat to people, then I see these two people.\n\nThey start combining the N word in chat to bypass swearing in Roblox, I wanted to report them for their behaviour but I decided to talk to them instead. One of the kids called me an \u201ce-dater\u201d (I don\u2019t e-date btw) and I proceeded to ask one of them how old they are. They said they are 17 so I let their immaturity aside and started talking to them some more. I asked if they are religious and they said they both were, now I understand people have their religious beliefs I grew up in a Christian household and both my parents are religious especially my father, however if you want to covert people into Christianity saying racial slurs and telling people they are awful when they did nothing wrong is not the way to do it.\n\nParents\u2026 PLEASE EDUCATE YOUR CHRISTIAN KIDS! Talk to them and ask them what games they are playing online because you do not know if your kid is going out, bullying people and using religion as a weapon to justify their behaviour. I am saying this as someone who would go online often when I was a minor. I was exposed to a lot of things and I also hated on people when they didn\u2019t do anything, they are still young and need someone to tell them this is not Christian like behaviour\u2026.\n\nAnyway I tried my best to be respectful and reasonable but idk if I should have minded my own business or not\u2026\n\nSo am I overreacting? \n\nG = Green R = Red Me = Blue\n\nAlso I will edit incase thing\u2019s don\u2019t make sense ",

They met me at the hotel, took my statement, and investigated the hotel room and staff as to her whereabouts.  Usually, the police don\u2019t respond unless it\u2019s over 24 hours of being missing, but Atlanta is the largest sex trafficking hub of the US, so they made an exception. \n\nBut finally, by 12:30pm, she walked into the hotel room. She said she took an Uber to a bar and tried to walk back to the hotel after her phone died, but she had to book a hotel room to stay at since she was already too drunk to walk further to the hotel. \n\nI gave her a hug and explained my concern. She was acting like I overreacted, and kicked me out of the hotel room after police came back to verify her return in person.

Should I have done nothing and stayed in the hotel room to take care of the dogs instead of worrying?

Mid sentence he stops talking and with a dark tone he says \u201coh my ex is calling\u201d. His mood completely changed after. He stopped talking and sounded like he was in shock. I felt like his heart had dropped. It made me feel like he still has feelings for her. They were together for 4 years and lived together but she broke it off and moved out a year ago. However they kept hooking up and trying to make it work but it never did\u2026 to me it sounds like they can\u2019t move on but try to. He once made a comment that he thinks they can\u2019t move on because they are so comfortable with each other. \n\nHe at first said he may call her back and that he isn\u2019t sure. But then he said he wasn\u2019t going to call her back. I brought up my feelings about the situation and he said that nothing is going on anymore and that he just got into a bad mood seeing her call him. I suggested we get off the phone and he agreed very quickly which made me feel like he went to call her after. \n\nI sent him a text after we got off the phone and maybe it was too accusatory but his reply felt inconsiderate to me. I am not sure if I am over reacting or not but if my ex called me I wouldn\u2019t bat an eye. I\u2019d just decline the call and keep talking to my new love interest.

And it lead to him being very drunk on the sundsy that I left his house. He didn\u2019t message me for ages, then did to say he was killing himself. Refused to answer calls and texts only to eventually say leave him alone, after I messaged his friend asking if he could get in contact with him. I went to sleep and woke up a few hours later and he was still up. I asked how he was and  he said \u2018I\u2019m not happy, I don\u2019t like who I am with you\u2019. He told me he didn\u2019t want to be with me anymore. I was obviously freaked out and asked to speak about it tomorrow and his reply? No thanks. And that was all til he messaged the next day and told me he had taken the day off work. Nothing about what had happened the night before. I just put that aside and tried to be supportive because he wasn\u2019t doing so well mentally and I couldn\u2019t bring it up while that was happening. \n\nI have since found out last night that he had added his ex girlfriend during that time, and only because I just had a strange feeling he would reach out to her. He did not tell me this and I\u2019ve been having trouble figuring out how I feel. He never would have told me it would have been a secret forever? Is it due to unresolved feelings on his part? I feel like my trust is betrayed and I\u2019m so paranoid he\u2019s just talking to her all the time now. I want to break up with him but I can\u2019t tell if that would be an overreaction, I don\u2019t know what they talked about it so how do I know it wasn\u2019t perfectly innocent and I\u2019d be doing it over nothing?? The screenshots are the conversation from this afternoon after I asked about him adding her and if they had talked. About an hour after this, he replied \u2018okay, I\u2019m over being annoyed now\u2019 and I haven\u2019t replied. Help?",

        "Background": "First time posting here but I am seriously in need of a reality check. I want to know who is in the wrong because I'm not able to look at the situation as clearly anymore. \n\nBACKSTORY:\n\nMy boyfriend (M45) and I F(27) met in 2022 when I started working at the same restaurant as he already did. We didn't really talk much but 6 months in to me working there is when he started to show interest and tried to pursue me. Took about 3 months of that for me to give him a chance. After our first time hanging out he told me he had been single for some time and that he was looking for someone to do stuff with like concerts, dinners, vacations etc. but keep it light. Being I am 17 years younger he also said he wouldn't want anything too serious with me since he wouldn't want to \"steal my youth\" or take away any experiences I should be having at my age. I said I love all those things and I would be down but that I thought he was full of it and just trying to spit some game at me. He asked me to name an artist I liked and if I have ever been to Hawaii to which I said yes (he had never been.) A couple days later he booked us a trip to Hawaii but we had to stop in Las Vegas first to go see the artist I liked who would be performing the day before our flights to Hawaii. I was surprised it wasn't all talk. Over that vacation we had a mix of fun and getting to know each other and how we are as partners in relationships to which I promptly said I cook but I am not the best with cleaning to which he said if I cook he would have zero issue doing his part by cleaning and doing any \"manly\" duties. This was the start of our relationship and we had been together ever since. We moved in with each other in 2023. \n\n\nTODAY'S ISSUE:\n\nFast forward to now, I haven't worked with him in a while but he uses work as an excuse not to do his part or the bare minimum. His motto has always been \"quick and easy\" and it's really getting to me that he is the lead server at his job never calls out and people praise all his hard work and efforts yet he comes home \"too tired\" for anything more as if I don't work myself. \"But I work REALLY hard\" is what I'm usually understanding of however that doesn't mean you get to check out. I've seen his work ethic because I worked there and it's amazing I just wish there was some of that leftover for our home and our relationship. He goes out of his way to give co workers rides and help people which I really do love but once he's in the door it's immediately to the couch and what's for dinner.\n\nYesterday (12/29) was our 2 year anniversary which he PROMISED he would take the day off whether he had to request it off or call out he would make it happen for me. My only requests were to spend the day together and it would be nice if he could make the reservation so I could be somewhat surprised. He didn't feel like making the reservation anywhere and said \"ugh baby just pick one!\" So I made two at places I like. Two days before the date he tried to tell me he wants to go to work to which I was very upset because he's had months notice of this and he could easily request or switch the days off with his coworkers. He asked off new years day but not our date which upset me even more like you could have done both or just chose the one. He realized I was upset and said he would keep his word and that he understands my feelings. The 28th at 10pm I got off work to call him and asked if I should pick up something to drink since we don't work the next day to which he said he was for sure going to work and going back on his word yet again. He said he doesn't feel comfortable not going to work on our anniversary (sunday) but he would want to do something the next day EVEN THOUGH HE STILL IS SCHEDULED. So you'll call out but just not that day? Attached pic is what I was met with. Please help me because this is another promise he hasn't kept and other promises he doesn't keep or leaves them until the last second and then guilt trips me. I need advice \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nBoyfriend promised to have anniversary plans. Tried to go back on it, said nevermind and he understood me, and then actually did cancel. Said he didn't feel comfortable calling out of work on that day but would call out the next day and he requested new years day off when he could have easily requested our day off instead or as well. He has a history of being wishy washy when it comes to his word and we have a 17 year age gap so I am left conflicted. ",

        "Background": "I (29M) have been in an on-and-off relationship with my boyfriend, let\u2019s call him D, since 2021. Our dynamic has always had tension because I\u2019m more emotionally expressive while he tends to shut down or act very nonchalant when conflict arises. This mismatch has led to recurring blowups, usually triggered by a lack of communication or emotional accountability on his part. We\u2019ve had moments where, after an argument, he\u2019ll finally circle back, take accountability, and we have a really meaningful talk about how to do better. But eventually\u2026 it always goes back to the same cycle.\n\nThe most recent situation is what\u2019s really messing with me now.\n\nD had a trip planned to visit his family in Atlanta. I knew the trip was coming, but I didn\u2019t know the exact day or time of his flight\u2014he never told me. This is weird because usually I drive him to the airport, get his itinerary, and we check in with each other during solo travels. This time, he just gave me a hug and kiss and left for the airport in the early afternoon. I was confused but let it slide initially, thinking maybe he forgot to ask if I was working (I had a 4PM shift, so I would\u2019ve been available).\n\nAfter he left, I started getting this curious feeling, so I tried calling him a few hours later while I was getting ready for work\u2014no answer. I figured he might\u2019ve been on the plane, so I texted. Still nothing. Tried again later that night after work, still nothing. I called and texted several times but got no response, and because I didn\u2019t even know his flight time, I couldn\u2019t check if there was a delay or problem. I didn\u2019t know if he made it or not. We\u2019ve never traveled separately without letting the other know when we\u2019ve landed or gotten settled so this was way out of character.\n\nI was genuinely concerned\u2014as he also has epilepsy, with drug-resistant seizures, so I worry sometimes if I don\u2019t hear from him like usual. It\u2019s not about control or anything (I don\u2019t want to be on the phone for hours all the time and have my own friends); it\u2019s about safety and love. And to go that long without a check-in\u2026 it was bothering my spirit. I finally fell asleep that night after trying to distract myself with gaming and talking with friends, but I was stressed undoubtedly.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up around 8:30AM still feeling disturbed. Tried calling again, no answer. Then about an hour later, he finally calls me. I was relieved at first\u2014thankful he was okay\u2014but quickly started feeling anger creep in. He tells me he was \u201cso tired\u201d when he got in and \u201chis phone died,\u201d so he just went to sleep. I didn\u2019t say much at first because I was trying to process it.\n\nEventually I called him back to talk it through calmly. I explained that I was hurt he didn\u2019t share his flight time, didn\u2019t ask for a ride, didn\u2019t check in like we usually do\u2014and given his condition, it just didn\u2019t sit right with me.\n\nHe immediately shut down. He got quiet, started deflecting, and said I\u201ccalled just to argue.\u201d I wasn\u2019t yelling or anything. I just wanted to understand why everything was different this time. He refused to explain anything, didn\u2019t want to answer basic questions like what time his flight was, and wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge why I\u2019d be upset. He just kept saying he \u201cdon\u2019t want to argue.\u201d That\u2019s when I felt myself start to spiral internally, this is exactly how our fights usually escalate. I feel dismissed and unheard, and eventually I get emotional, and then he listens and apologizes (usually days later or months if we break up because of it). But it shouldn\u2019t take me getting there for him to care.\n\nTo clarify, he has said before that he avoids emotionally charged conversations most times because it could stress him out and possibly trigger a seizure. I completely understand that and try to be mindful of it. But when it\u2019s used every time we need to talk about anything uncomfortable (something bound to occur in a relationship), it starts to feel like a cop-out rather than an honest boundary. I\u2019m exhausted from being the only one trying to communicate like an adult while walking on eggshells because I\u2019m afraid of making him shut down or something.\n\n(Just to be clear, I do understand that being exhausted after a flight and having a dead phone are valid things that can happen\u2014I\u2019m not oblivious to that. I\u2019m not trying to blow up over something minor. It\u2019s more about the principle and the pattern. The overall situation just felt off, and it left me feeling dismissed, confused, and unimportant\u2014especially given our history and how we usually handle things.)\n\nI ended the call before I exploded because I didn\u2019t want to argue or say something I\u2019d regret. But now I\u2019m sitting here wondering\u2026 was I wrong for bringing it up? Am I the asshole for being upset he didn\u2019t communicate during a trip, especially knowing the usual routine? Or am I just doing too much?\n\nI love this man, and I\u2019ve stood by him through a lot. But I\u2019m starting to feel like this roller coaster may never end and I don\u2019t know how much more I can take.",

I put some pants on and went out into my living room, and this kid was running around my living room and kitchen, playing with my dogs with no worry in the world\u2026 \ni tried to get him to calm down and asked him what his name was or where his parents were and nothing. he ignored me and kept playing. after a couple of minutes, i think he got bored, and he opened my door, went out the gate, and ran out to the back of my house. i lost sight of him and continued to look out towards the road in case i could figure out where he came from. finally, i saw a young girl approaching from the neighbors side of the road and she shouted at me \u201cwhere is he!!?\u201d i told her i had no idea where he was but that i had seen him go towards the back of my house and she could go look for him. she looked annoyed but i guess she was able to grab him at some point and took him back towards the direction our neighbors house is at. at that point i had honestly been super upset a yelled \u201ckeep that kid out of my property and out of my house\u201d to which she just yelled \u201csorry\u201d over her shoulder. after that, no one ever came back to apologize. my husband eventually went to the family to ask what had happened and was told that they had been unloading groceries and the little boy had managed to run away. (how they didn\u2019t realize this until so much later im not sure)\nanyways. a year later, i would say this little boy is 5 or 6 now, i get a call from my husband while we are at work. he tells me theres a little boy in our house, and that he came in through our dog door. immediately i ask if its the same one as last time. he says he saw them on our cameras but he cant be sure. he tells me that before calling me, he already called the cops, but that they are on their way. the footage shows this kid opening our closed, fenced gate, and coming to our front door. our dogs are barking at him in the yard. he attempts to open the front door, sees its locked, knocks, and then just stands there thinking. THEN. he crawls in through our dog door\u2026 our dogs have the ability to go in and out of the house as they like since their fence is closed in. but i guess this kid just figured he could do the same? anyways. he comes in, and opens the dog door to make sure the dogs can come in too. HE TAKES OFF HIS SHOES WHEN HE COMES IN\u2026 and then he goes on to jump on my couch and play with my dogs. after that, he turns on my tv, GOES INTO MY FRIDGE AND GRABS ICEPOPS, AND EATS AN ORANGE FROM OUR FRUIT BASKET\u2026. huh?!?!??  he is in our house unsupervised for a total of about 15 minutes until the cops arrive and are able to get him out (he crawled out through the dog door). the cops ask him his name, and he tells them. they ask w his parents are and where he lives, and he tells them as well. the cops tell him he is mot allowed to do this, that it is not his house. a couple minutes later, a car pulls into my driveway. its the parents\u2019. the cops talk to them for a bit and they all leave. my husband had left work to get home but by the time he got here everyone was gone. the cops pretty much just said that it was just a kid being a kid. my husband then went down to the neighbors and told the parents to take care of their kid. ( i was upset because he did wait for me to go talk to them, he knew how upset i was). the dad apologized and stated that the boy had been grounded and snuck out through his bedroom window. apparently he just likes to play with my dogs. the dad told the little boy to apologize to my husband. at this, the little boy SPIT AT HIS DAD. \na week later, my husband got a call from the parents, asking if by chance this kid was in our house again, because they could not find him. we were both at work but did not see him in any of our cameras. \nat this point ive calmed down quite a bit, but as soon as i remember i get quite mad. i think it is insanely upsetting that im more aware of where this little boy is than his own parents are. once again, he is not right next door to me. he had to  be unsupervised for at least thirty minutes in order to make his way to my house, ( about. a five minute walk), be here for 15 minutes and have the cops get here until his parents found him. he knows what he is doing, the parents are aware, but no one truly takes accountability for it. the little boy says he likes to play with my dogs, but instead of playing with them in my yard, comes into my house and makes himself at home. i feel bad for calling the cops but. i truly feel like theres a need to report this because im scared for my safety and that of my animals and property. if he were to leave the gate open, my dogs would definitely run out into the main road and get run over. my house is not childproofed at all. WE HAD A FLAMETHROWER ON THE KITCHEN TABLE THE DAY HE CAME IN (my husband had killed a spider outside with it). i am concerned for this little boy\u2019s safety but at the same time i do not want to be responsible or liable if anything were to happen to him out in our property. i also would like to feel safe in my own home. i dont feel like i should be having to keep my dogs in a kennel all day and close their doggy door just because there is a kid out there who is not monitored and was never taught to respect people\u2019s privacy. if he snuck out through his window im sure he could sneak in through one as well. theres so many what ifs in this situation and it might just be my anxiety but i am definitely very upset. i guess this is more of a rant and i just hope this doesn\u2019t happen again because i do intend to have the cops on speed dial, but again\u2026 am i overreacting?

At the funeral he said he hated us and that he doesn\u2019t wish well upon us. He said that to a huge group of angry right wingers. Who are already mad and ready to jump to kill others. \r\n-\t We out number him and he knows that. At the last kings rally there was at least 5 million people that were involved. In the report by the counterterror they state to stay away from large gatherings like concerts or anything. \r\n-\tWe have 300 + million people who live in the states but only around 150million vote.

He wants a war to start to delay the November election. He has close ties with the Taliban.  \r\n\r\nHe is setting up a reason for Al\u2019 quade to attack on US soil. They will attack the October 18th protest and murder all the people who oppose trump since they will all be in one place. The amount of people who will die will be enough to change the outcome of elections and there's enough people left in the US who don\u2019t care, move on and think this was another terrorist attack. There will be enough people to continue working, spend money and not ask questions about what is happening. Everyone who wants change will be gone and the rich people will continue making money. \r\n\r\nThey are pushing for families for the same reason they forced slaves to have babies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter the United States abolished the international slave trade in 1808, slaveholders increased their focus on forced reproduction to grow the enslaved population\u201d \r\n\r\nThat is why they want people to have kids so they can go to the school and be taught the new version of education that involves the bible. They will make sure they will be obedient angels and get ready to work for nothing. \r\n\r\nSo after the October attack, the elections will be delayed, and by the time we have them again, he will have killed enough people to sway the votes.

        "Background": "A couple months ago she blocked me because she got upset and shes been doing that since middle school like blocks me when she gets upset. Well last time, I reached out to her because I assumed she didn\u2019t want to be friends so I reached out to make sure and I told her I don't like being blocked and that I'll end the friendship if she does it again. And time passes and tbh I barely text her because I wanted to avoid her asking why I haven't came over and I told her this. (First screenshot)\n\nAfter that she blocks me and a month later, today, younger sibling (haven\u2019t even reached their teens) asks me why we aren't friends anymore and I tell them that I didn\u2019t like her pressuring me to come over when she never took the effort to try to come over to my place which is true. Obviously I don\u2019t want to tell my young sibling about the weed part.\n\nI was wondering how my younger sibling knows we aren\u2019t friends anymore and I find out bff been texting my sibling. (3rd,4th,5th and 6th screenshot)\n\nShe's accusing me of lying because I told my sibling how she always pressured me because she would get upset that I don't have time or hang out with her. But she has never tried to hang out either but would only accuse me of not spending time. She\u2019s home 24/7. Also I haves talked to her about her accusing me of not making effort but the times in the last 2 years, she only came over twice just because I convinced her (we live 15 min away from each other) . I texted my bff after to tell her that I don\u2019t like her talking to my young sibling like that. Telling them that weed helps and talking about edibles. These are things I had hidden away from my younger sibling because I don\u2019t want them to take bad influence of me. My sibling really wants me to continue to be friends but I really don\u2019t like how she was talking to my sibling. I told my older sibling the whole thing and they feel the same as me. I feel like this should have been only a us situation and if she really wanted us to continue being friends then she would talk directly to me. She says she wants to continue being friends but she was the one that blocked me and I really find this whole back and forth blocking shit annoying. Iv also made a post about her blocking me constantly and talked to different friends because this is something that really bothered me and multiple people will tell me things along the lines of \u201cshe's controlling\u201d. \n\nA bit of context on what she is talking about, we used to smoke weed together but I started to get paranoid so I stopped doing it so Often and only every couple of months. It's been 6 months since I last smoked. My bff on the other hand, she has had me walked her outside, no matter if its raining, just for her to smoke weed and she is ALWAYS HIGH. My bf smokes cigarettes but not often because I expressed to him how I don't like it so he does not do it often. He smokes like a cigarette a week and only rebuys like a month later. Me and my bff are both in our 20s btw.\n\nTLDR\n\nbff blocks me all the time when she gets upset since middle school. Last time she did, I told her I won\u2019t be friends if she does it again. I barely text her because I wanted to avoid her accusing me of not putting in effort and she gets upset when I bring up how she doesn\u2019t do much herself either but only I take the blame (I\u2019m always the one to come over and she never does so I didn\u2019t see it as a big deal to NOT come over much anymore). We stop being friends because I told her only one of the reasons. My younger sibling asks why we aren\u2019t friends. I told my sibling the other reason. The same reason ig adressed with my bff multiple times. Then I find out she\u2019s talking to my younger 12 year old sibling about shit that only adults should be talking about. And now I\u2019m really fucking pissed. ",

        "Background": "So yes, I do feel like I might have ADHD, but I don\u2019t know if I just feel that way because I\u2019m uninformed.\n\nEver since I was little, I\u2019ve listened carefully to my parents instructions (whether it\u2019s a rule about putting things back where they\u2019re meant to be or telling me to do something for my siblings bc I\u2019m the oldest) but somehow the instructions still slipped my mind and I\u2019d do the dumbest things. I also started losing my stuff. I thought it was just my childhood personality, but then as I got older (12) my father accused me of being lazy, ungrateful, and stupid because I never followed instructions and was always on my phone. After that I went into a state of resentment.\n\nLater, I started reading a comic with someone who had ADHD, and learned what it was. I found it really interesting, especially with the \u201cSonic has ADHD\u201d stuff on the internet. Stupid me thought it was cool. \n\nIt was just after that in my last year of middle school that I noticed I had some ADHD like traits. Im introverted and actually almost always sitting down cuz I like drawing and watching anime, so I later thought maybe I was just exaggerating and trying to feel special or unique so that I wouldn\u2019t feel stupid like my dad said. But when I searched it up, the internet said people with ADHD can actually sit down and do something for long periods of time due to their abnormal hyperfocus when engaging in tasks they find extremely interesting. Sketching, anime, and writing is what makes up most of my hobbies, and I find myself doing it till 2am on a SCHOOL NIGHT without being able to stop myself? Is that hyperfocus? Not to mention when I\u2019m sitting down and not doing any hobbies, I\u2019m always bouncing my leg and/or stretching to move even a single part of my body. \n\nI\u2019ve formed a habit of zoning out and daydreaming about characters I created in my head when I was little and still do it to this day (with characters from the fiction I\u2019m writing). \n\nMy dad is super strict since he lived in a small village when he was little and had a very disciplined lifestyle like fetching water from the river and sweeping the entire compound around his house, etc. so he always made us do work books at home on the summer for a majority of 5 hours a day except on weekends. I didn\u2019t focus at all most of the time and let my mind wander, constantly picking up my phone and losing track of time while on Pinterest.\n\nTests have shown (tests I took online for clarity) that some people with ADHD find it hard to sleep at night when not doing anything (yes), have hyperfocus when doing hobbies they consider very interesting (yes), have difficulty listening to and remembering instructions (yes), interrupt others and have trouble waiting their turn (yes), lose things often (yes), get easily distracted by external stimuli (yes), and procrastinate when I should be completing projects or house work. Must I proceed?\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do I have ADHD and need to get a professional check or something? Or am I overreacting? \n\nEdit: Not self diagnosing using AI ofc lol, just that this is the last thing I looked up before posting. \ud83d\ude05 I have gone on websites, read articles, and taken quizzes.

He had  tell me about him getting it because our apartment is so small and I am unemployed atm after losing my job so I\u2019m at the apartment all the time. So, he couldn\u2019t really bring in a 5ft-6ft package secretly and just never bring up what was in the package. It\u2019s one of those almost life-like ones, I asked him how much it cost and he wouldn\u2019t tell me. I threw out \u201cwas it $1000\u201d, he said \u201cmore\u201d. He also grossly told me \u201cit has every hole\u201d (tmi)\n\nI own a bunch of self pleasure toys myself lol so idrc about the idea of him having one, thought it was weird that I essentially HAD to know it due to the circumstances though. \n\nAnyway, literally a few hours later after this I was chilling in my bed and I heard his bed squeaking, wall being banged, grunting (almost yelling honestly like wtf), pleasure moans etc bc he\u2019s doing\u2026\u2026\u2026 the obvious. The only two rooms in the apartment share a wall so that doesn\u2019t help. whatever, he\u2019s having fun with his new toy I tell myself (so weird I have to even think about this) \n\nProblem is, for the last week, multiple times, every night, I have to hear this. Literally got woken up by it one night. I can\u2019t take it anymore. \n\nI want to confront him, but how should I? He can do whatever he wants I guess, and if he had a girlfriend or something I would have to hear similar noises regardless.

        "Background": "Long time lurker, first time poster. I (42m) have been dating my gf (40f) for a little over 6 mos. Around a month into the relationship we had the conversation to be exclusive. Things have been going great, see each other once or twice a week (I have a kid 50% of the time so we make time when we can).\n\nAt the beginning of the relationship she had a good job (low 6 figures). She also takes care of her mom who has health issues and receives a check from the govt for being her caretaker. She also lives in low-income housing (was grandfathered in from before she got her corporate job). This all factors in later.\n\nLike I said things have been great, we love each other, do fun/cute dates, have cozy nights in, awesome. With one exception - she would seemingly disappear every sat night from about 7pm until about 11am the next day. There would usually be one check-in/goodnight text in the evening but then she\u2019d be gone again (wouldn\u2019t read/reply to any of my subsequent texts). Every week it was another excuse, but mostly revolved around her taking care of her sick mom. \n\nWhat was weird to me is that during the week or on Friday nights she would come to my place, she\u2019d spent the night, we\u2019d go out on weekdays to fairs/museums/etc and she\u2019d leave her mom home alone for anywhere from 12-36 hours or so. So it was weird to me that ONLY on sat nights she had to be so hands-on with her mom that she couldn\u2019t even text. I bring this up to her a few times and she tells me I\u2019m being silly/paranoid. It starts bothering more (I would love a weekend trip/sat night date nights/etc) and I bring it up more often, and about 3 weeks ago when she\u2019s in the middle of a disappearing act I finally ask if she can share her location (prob not my finest idea) and she says \u201cwe\u2019re not playing this game\u201d and goes radio silent again until the next day. \n\nFollowing week on Thurs she tells me \u201chey just a heads-up I\u2019m gonna be taking my mom out on sat so I\u2019m gonna be too tired to hang out sat night.\u201d Basically I say I\u2019ve had enough of the disappearing act, I apologize if I\u2019m being crazy, but it\u2019s EVERY sat night for 6 mos. I tell her I can\u2019t do this any more and need a break. She gets upset, asks if I can call her, and proceeds to tell me she has a \u201cjob\u201d on sat nights that she can\u2019t tell me too much about.\n\nLong story short I get most of it out of her - thru a friend of a friend about 1.5 yrs ago (a year before she met me) she was introduced to an 80yd old man who needs a \u201ccaretaker\u201d. However, these duties involve going on dates with him: dinners, corporate functions (I don\u2019t know who this guy is but sounds important), and movies at home on the couch. He introduces her as his \u201cdate\u201d, they cuddle on the couch together watching movies, and she sleeps in bed with him overnight, sometimes cuddling. Doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much other \u201ccaretaking\u201d involved.\n\nShe insists that this isn\u2019t \u201ccheating\u201d bc there\u2019s nothing sexual and bc she\u2019s paid for it (it\u2019s her \u201cjob - he basically pays all of her bills) and that I\u2019m overreacting. I contend it IS cheating bc she\u2019s been going on dates and doing intimate things (cuddling, etc) with another man (regardless of age or emotional connection) and, more importantly, bc she LIED about it for 6 mos. Had she told me about it from the beginning at least I would have had the autonomy to consent or not to being with someone in this type of relationship. To be honest, I might have even been ok with it, but at least I would have had a choice.\n\nAnother note, she quit her regular corporate job a few mos ago to \u201cspend more time taking care of her mom\u201d. So now this is basically her primary source of income, so I kinda get why she can\u2019t quit it now. Last thing, she came over last weekend to talk it out and I asked to see her phone (never done this before). She only had two chats in her texts (she had no explanation where any of the other chats went - I think maybe she has a 2nd phone?) and in her deleted texts she had a message a month ago from an ex basically confessing his love to her and asking if he could take her shopping. Her text response was \u201clet me think about it\u201d; she tells me she didn\u2019t see him or talk to him again after that exchange.\n\nAnyway am I overreacting and is this cheating (she keeps arguing it\u2019s not)?",

I immediately apologized and said I should have responded better, and we went to bed.\n\nThe next day he came home from work and when I asked if we could make up, and tried to explain the past hurt me and it would really help just to hear that he sees mistakes were made that won't be made again, and that caused him to get furious.

I paid over $1200 for 5 nights and from the photos and reviews, this place looked great. \n\nOn the first night I got there I started to notice some things, the amount of DUST and cobwebs everywhere was insane (and I\u2019m not just talking about in the hard to reach places, I mean THICK cobwebs on the floor, and items on the floor being covered in dust), and the toilet brush was just lying on the floor?? Yuck. There was stuff in the bins already when I got there, and the stuff in the dishwasher hadn\u2019t been put away, and it was also just quite dirty in general with mould all around the seals and what not. The shower head also didn\u2019t work/was broken, which wasn\u2019t great since I could only use the small hand held \u201cshower head\u201d (had the water pressure of a garden hose with a kink in it, and was smaller than the palm of my hand) to try and bathe myself. Oh and the bedroom I was in didn\u2019t have a dial for the fan as it has been ripped off or something, so that wasn\u2019t usable. \n\nFor the next issue I wasn\u2019t able to get photos since I was absolutely terrified, but the bed I was sleeping in had spiders in the pillow cases and bed (I do NOT do well with spiders \ud83d\ude2d). Additionally there was spiders all throughout the rest of the house. Now look, spiders on the wall aren\u2019t going to be enough for me to want a refund, but spiders in the bed is a whole different story. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m crazy but I just didn\u2019t feel like this was worth over $1200 and wasn\u2019t to a very clean standard, so I got a different accomodation. I\u2019m more than happy to pay for the first night I spent there of course, I mean, I stayed there so of course I\u2019ll pay. \n\nI texted the host about the issues, sent photos and how I\u2019d like a partial refund, but she\u2019s refused, stating my claim is \u201cexcessive\u201d and that it\u2019s not dirty, \u201cjust old\u201d and that the shower head does work, I just needed to use a switch to change which shower head is in use. She\u2019s clearly not looked at any of the photos I\u2019ve sent as she would see that the photos prove what I\u2019m saying. Oh also, she said that she can\u2019t \u201ccontrol the spiders\u201d so there\u2019s nothing to be done about that. Look, as an Aussie, I\u2019d have my house treated if I was going to be hosting it out, and I can tell you right now, none of my treated homes have ever had spiders in the bed. The walls sure, but the beds and pillowcases? Come on now. \n\nAm I wrong for wanting a partial refund? I\u2019m a student and $1200 is an insane amount of money to be paying for a house that doesn\u2019t even look like it\u2019s been cleaned. The cleaning fee alone is almost $100! \n\nI\u2019ve contacted Airbnb and they\u2019re now getting involved but I just thought I should reach out and ask other people.

My bf went with his parents for food so he asked me what I wanted and even said he knew I wanted biscuits and gravy and I said an omelette with a side of biscuits and gravy. But he came back with only biscuits and gravy for himself. I asked about mine and he told me he thought I wanted grits. I repeated what I wanted and said next time I'll just text you as a reminder. He said I should do that. So walked off with a disappointed look on my face and went back to work. He asked me if I'm upset and I said yeah I was a little let down because this happens a lot and I felt unheard and he just goes off on me saying he didn't do it on purpose, I'm not grateful,  and I should be grateful I got free food while talking over me where I can't get any point across. I'm not even upset. I just was a little let down and I feel like I should be able to feel that way. I wasn't going to hold it over him. So I sent him this text message because I'm frustrated that our fights almost always begin like this and I don't feel like I have the freedom to have anything other than a positive feeling around him without him taking it as an attack. \nMaybe I should have, been a little less wordy or waited a little bit to text him or waited till he got home but I thought he would accuse me of bringing it back up but the only issue is I just want the freedom to feel any feelings I want without being told they're not valid or I'm making a mountain out of a molehill.

        "Background": "So, this argument happened months ago at this point, but it's been pretty consistently bugging me since then, so I need to know if I was actually the one that was being unreasonable here. For context, me and this person had been broken up for a couple of years at this point. The relationship had been very serious and it was a pretty messy breakup, but we tried at least a few times to still be friends. At the time this argument happened, we had just started talking again after almost a year of no contact because of another, different, fight we had, and we'd only been talking again for a couple of days. In this short time span, he sent me at least three different selfies with absolutely NO context. No words, nothing meaningful that was actually worth responding to, not even an attempt to look good so it wasn't a matter of fishing for compliments. I've ALWAYS been the type to think it's ridiculous to do that, and I usually just ignore stuff like that when it gets sent to me and most people get the hint and stop doing that, but I knew that he wasn't going to stop unless I actually said something about it because he does that sort of thing so frequently. As you can see in the first screenshot, he did it to me TWICE in the span of only one hour, and I know that he did it at least one more time before those screenshots.\nThe reason this has been bothering me for so long is because I sent the screenshots to a few different friends at the time to get their opinions, and while most of them were very much on my side, ONE of them asked me why the hell I'm even talking to him on Snapchat if I DON'T want to get random selfies, and said that that's how most people use Snapchat and it shouldn't be such a big deal to me. I only even use Snapchat because it's what so many of my friends prefer for some godawful reason, but most of my friends know that I don't like being spammed with unnecessary selfies and don't send me anything unless they have something worthwhile to say, and I feel like he should be able to understand if I just don't want to see that sort of thing. It's not like me seeing his face was horribly upsetting to me or anything because I'm over the relationship entirely and there aren't any lingering romantic feelings, but now that I'm not madly and hopelessly in love with him, I just don't find it cute and adorable anymore when he does that sort of thing. When we were IN the relationship, my response to his random nonsensical selfies was always \"awww look at him being all adorable and looking for attention\" but after the breakup, all I can think about is \"okay? What exactly do you expect me to do with this? You've given me NOTHING to respond to and made me stop what I was doing and waste my time just to look at.... Your face? For no reason??\" And of course I've never actually said that because I'm not THAT much of a bitch, but I can't help feeling that way. So, am I the one that's overreacting here??",

        "Background": "(Sorry, repost. I got anxious bd deleted it after a couple of minutes) \n\nBit about me: I\u2019m navigating a shift from corporate to academic research and came back to India for some training courses so I get comfortable in the lab before I apply for research internships/positions. I paid for a lab training course in Bangalore to help me refresh my skills. \n\nWhen I got there yesterday, I realised that the pictures on their web page did not match the reality of the lab set up. Nobody was wearing lab coats, there was no hood, most of the equipment does not work, they don\u2019t have a biosafety cabinet and yet, right in the middle of the lab, they were handling stool samples (both human and animal) on a random bench with no masks. Bit of the supernatant collected after centrifuging was seen on the bench, on the floor and on the gloves of the interns doing the extraction. They touch the chairs, their clothes, your clothes and skin with the same gloves. Some of the liquid splattered on my hands. Nothings sectioned off. They don\u2019t even autoclave their pipette tips, micro centrifuge tubes and don\u2019t even have proper disposal of fecal matter residues. The whole place is a biohazard. \n\nWhen I paid for the workshop, nothing was made aware. On top of all this, the person who recruited me for the workshop shared the details of a completely different training program and when I brought it up he completely disregarded what I was saying and gaslighted me and told me that I might\u2019ve read it on their website and got confused. He was fully dismissive (I did not have my phone on me to show him the fkn email he sent) So even the coordination is terrible. The interns I met came from far away places and told me they were mislead by the lab website too and were confused by the lab standards but decided to go with it anyway because it was free for them. \n\nI messaged them once I got back home and there has been a very corporate friendly back and forth where I tell them about my experience and they completely disregard it and don\u2019t answer about their lab\u2019s condition. I have worked in underfunded labs and small labs in India when I was in undergrad and they were always transparent, always clean and followed all safety protocols. There are really great labs in this city and country but there also places like this apparently. IDK how this lab has clients.\n\nI have anxiety and have trouble standing up for myself and I have trouble with confrontation. But, I\u2019ve been working on myself this past year and have decided not to just give in like I usually do. My hands have been trembling and my heart palpitations are back and I have this gnawing feeling of \u201clet it go\u201d. But if I do, that means I\u2019m back to my old habits where I let people get their way with me. \n\nTell me if I\u2019m over reacting or am I in the right for standing up for myself. \n\nPS I SCRUBBED myself clean 3 times and still feel like I\u2019m covered in shit. I also don\u2019t want to have this \u201cface to face\u201d conversation with them because I know how this will go down. Was I rude with my messages? Was I too aggressive? Maybe I went a little overboard because of my experience with the lab and the people there idk\n\nUPDATE: I got ghosted/scammed. I've sent messages and did not hear back from them whatsoever.

It has been rocky since the beginning of marriage, as most of our relationship was long-distance and no surprise you get to know the person once you live together. Because of cultural and religious reasons we couldn't move in together until married and we both live abroad now, I was living here and he moved to me after marriage.\nHe is a very negative and skeptical person. Fails to have serious conversations and tends to joke instead. \nI have been depressed since my teen years and have anxiety. Which means countless panic attacks and self-harm. He is making fun of all that, saying depression isn't real, and if it is then I have nothing to be depressed about because \"you have job, home (rented btw), your mom loves you\". Every time I share any problems he says to get over it or asks for reasons why would that happen and then gets suspicious that I have some unknown problems that I don't want to share with him because I might be cheating or a boyfriend broke up with me or I did something bad.\nFast forward to today, yet again, I said I was feeling depressed again and couldn't fall asleep normally for the past 2-3 days ( he has been sleeping on the couch because he plays video games with his friend at night and falls asleep on the couch, because I told him few times to lower the noise when he was in bed with me but he flipped out and now chooses to sleep on the couch and closed the door of the bedroom behind him). He kept on asking why suddenly I feel like that, joked again that did my lover break up with me (I have no idea why this particular sentence keeps recurring, no I have never cheated or gave any reason for him to think I have). I followed by telling him what could be a reason, which are plenty: We live in Nordic country, now it gets dark after 3pm. I had changes at my job, all coworkers I worked with left but I can't change jobs due do documents being tied to a workplace. My only best friend left the country a year ago so I pretty much stopped going out unless it's a work event. I just overall mentioned some of the things that are bugging me and his response was \"You are suspiciously giving too many details to me\". Is this how a loving person should react when you are sharing your problems? Why can't he just be supportive? I told him it is effed up how he always makes me crazy when I share something and all he said was \"Sure buddy\". AIO?

The first night I moved she accused me of moving her cooking spoon, I didn\u2019t, I had only been in the kitchen to put my shopping away but she was quite adamant so I smiled and nodded and let it go. \nA few weeks later she started up with demanding I clean things, such as spilt tea on the side and the microwave, this didn\u2019t bother me as I do clean after myself so I know any mess is probably not me, (there\u2019s four of us here). \nA week or so after that she accused me of opening someone else\u2019s mail, not her mail but one of the other girls, and her latest thing has been about soap suds in the sink after I have washed the dishes.

        "Background": "Disclaimer: I know made the mistake of reaching out to her twice trying to ask for answers/closure. It\u2019s pretty pathetic, I know, and I really regret reaching out the second time. I got clowned for it, I totally get it. But, attached is her response to the second time I reached out to her, which makes me suspect she really did leave me for the \u201cother guy\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ll try to keep it brief, but here is the story.\n\nMy (19M) ex LDR GF (18F) broke up with me a month ago after 1.5 years of dating for the very vague reason of \u201cI lost feelings, but I don\u2019t know when or why it happened.\u201d She said she was \u201cdrained\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t gonna love for a while\u201d and \u201cfocus on herself.\u201d \n\nI was taken aback as this was on a random Wednesday and I thought we were going really, really well. We had recently gotten back together for 2.5 months after a month of being \u201cbroken up\u201d for a different reason, but we reconciled and she and I both said repeatedly we were so in love and happy.\n\nAfter some mixed signals from her right after the breakup (i.e. unblocking me on a game for \u201cguild communication\u201d, an IG story about \u201calmost breaking no contract), three weeks after it I noticed she started matching pfps with another guy, a friend of hers she added on Discord about two months prior to our breakup, and that they made a love song playlist together. \n\nShe\u2019s mentioned this friend to me several times while we were dating in that two month span (i.e. \u201comg i feel so bad he broke up with his gf\u201d, \u201che pisses me off sm\u201d, \u201cthis is what he looks like LOL\u201d, \u201che showed me these reels now im addicted), and I didn\u2019t really have any suspicions because I trusted her and really thought nothing of it. I did get a little suspicious when he started following her on Instagram, and immediately around that time she removed highlights and posts of herself because \u201cI didn\u2019t slay in them\u201d, but I didn\u2019t bring it up because I didn\u2019t want to be insecure.\n\nAnyways, I would later find out they would stop following each other, and their playlist would disappear only a few days after it was created. I would reach out to her a week after this, asking a couple questions for any closure and to try to make sense of what had happened, as I was really struggling. She told me she still didn\u2019t know why her feelings disappeared, and that she felt bad for me and wanted me to move on. I had started to move on after this.\n\nA few days after this exchange, I noticed that her Instagram profile popped up on my suggested accounts - she had unblocked me. Additionally she had made her profile public (it had always since we dated been private). Why? I had no clue.I then noticed while unblocked that she had started reposting hella reels about \u201cmissing my ex\u201d and wanting to reconcile. This looped me back into the mindset that maybe she started second guessing, as this was the same behavior she admitted to doing during our first breakup.\n\nI would notice the following couple days she would block-unblock-block-unblock, and like more reels about missing her ex, etc. I had also noticed that she would refollow that same \u201cfriend\u201d she matched pfps with and made that playlist with, which added on more to my confusion.\n\nI decided to follow her again and like one of her posts to see what her reaction would be. Immediately blocked. I had started to become really confused by this point, and decided (mistakenly) to reach out another time, to ask why she had been unblocking and reblocking me repeatedly, what her relationship with that guy was about, etc.\n\nI then got the following response. It was really weird to me.\n\nI understand my biggest mistake was not letting go of this situation a lot earlier - it\u2019s a huge waste of time and I looked very pathetic, even if I wanted to find an answer to a very vague breakup and make sense of it all.\n\nBut AIO for thinking that the \u201cfriend\u201d was the main reason for her \u201closs of feelings\u201d so suddenly? \n",

This was 100% his idea that he brought up on his own, and since I\u2019ve never been to LA, he talked about being excited to show me around. \n\nFor context, we\u2019ve been dating about 8 months. He\u2019s usually a wonderful, super attentive boyfriend who makes me feel very loved. We have a great relationship.\n\nMy BF\u2019s older brother and his girlfriend live in LA. We\u2019ve talked about visiting them or even staying with them while we\u2019re there. I\u2019ve only met them a few times, but we get along well, and there are no issues.\n\nYesterday, my BF casually tells me that *he* is going to LA for 4th of July and bought tickets for himself, his brother, and brother\u2019s GF to go to a baseball game. This is something he decided the day before.\n\nI am confused and hurt. I ask him why he would do that without including me since we had been (at his prompting!!) talking about going to LA together that weekend.\n\nHe immediately turns apologetic and starts explaining that a week or so earlier he\u2019d had the thought that his brother might want him to come alone. He never brought it up with me, and then when his brother hit him up about going to a baseball game, he pulled the trigger and quickly bought 3 tickets without thinking about me.\n\nThen he starts offering to find me a ticket and saying that he wants me to come along. But now I feel like an afterthought, since he literally just told me that he had forgotten about me. I don\u2019t want to go at all now. I ask him to leave (we were hanging out at my house).\n\nOf course, the whole thing is so weird that it makes me suspicious that he\u2019s not telling me something. But he\u2019s never given me a reason not to trust him in the past. He\u2019s honest to a fault usually. He swears that he\u2019s not hiding anything and that he just had brain fog when he bought them and didn\u2019t think of me.\n\nAm I overreacting by finding this extremely hurtful? He is calling and texting me constantly since last night to apologize, but I feel like the apologies don\u2019t help. The damage has already been done.

First of all, I had no idea it would blow up like that, from the bottom of my heart, I am so grateful for every single person who took time out of their day to write out a reply, it truly was so helpful!! \n\nIf you didn't see that post, I'm Mae, I'm 15, and a parents I was babysitting for refused to pay me because they found my outfit inappropriate.\n\nAround the same time the post started to blow up, my mom sent out an email to my neighbor/the mother, she never got a response, which was not very surprising, as they do not get along very well due to opposing political beliefs and religions, etc (my mom is jewish, she's very catholic). A lot of people suggested taking my neighbor to small claims court, but where I am at, the price of even filling a claim is half the money I would have made, as well as the fact that we live in a small town and my neighbor is a huge member of her church and very 'popular' (not really sure how to phrase it in a non highschooler way haha) so it just would not have been worth it.\n\nAnyways, I sent another text, got a response, etc etc, and the rest of the story is included over the texts. Again, thank you so so much for all the kind words. \n\n(Side note: a lot of people have asked where I got my tanktop, its from brandy melville, the \"skylar stripe lace tank\"!!)",

So we have been in this apartment for almost a year in April and the water has always had a weird smell to it as we are on a well and just thought it was because of that. But recently the water in the tub has been yellow also, when I give my son a bath I put a washcloth in the drain with a cap to block the drain and every night I give him a bath the washcloth has orange all over it where the water was slowing coming trough and it was filtering this orange stuff. I refuse to bathe my son in this so I texted him with a picture of the bath and told him that this was still happening and at this point I\u2019m not comfortable using the water. Mind you I\u2019ve been saying something about the water for maybe 3-4 months. So this morning I texted him saying good morning so the water still gross and stinks like Pennie\u2019s and is yellow. My son hasn\u2019t been able to bathe in 3 days because of it. (We have been using bottled water to wash him) so after that text my phone died and he texted and said I will be over in a little bit..I didn\u2019t answer but still chose to come up which that alone kind of pisses me off like he should have at least waited for me to say okay that\u2019s fine. Just find it rude. So my father in law was outside and was coming inside and I guess the landlord just followed him up but then he started taking pictures of my living room and kitchen WITHOUT EITHER ME OR MY BOYFRIENDS PERMISSION!! But I didn\u2019t know that so when I came out finally he started talking to me about the water and saying how he\u2019s going to get it tested because nothing is wrong with the apartment water below us or his and they are all ran off the same stuff then as I\u2019m talking to him he pulls out his phone gets the camera and takes 2 pictures of my cat and then was like oh no what am I doing, like bro you CLEARLY just took photos of my cat. But like I know that there is something wrong because my sons skin breaks out in bumps and also the water sometimes stinks like eggs and Pennie\u2019s then will be so yellow that it stains my baby\u2019s bath seat.

        "Background": "For background info im 17F. So basically my mom started dating this guy after getting divorced. She lives in another state so besides hearing him over the phone during facetimes i dont see him very often. One time i did go over to visit my mom it was chill. He didnt really speak to me when my mom wasnt around and I thought nothing of him because I already had a step mom so I knew what it was like having them around. \n\nComing back to my dads, a few months later I get a text from my step dad on my birthday. I was like oh! My mom js gave him my phone number to tell me happy birthday. I thought nothing of it abd responded normally saying thank you. I didnt think he would keep texting though.\n\nCouple weeks go by he continued to text me asking me what i was doing and how my day was. At the time i thought he was just being nice and that was it since he would ask me how me and my bf were doing and stuff like that. But then he would literally text me everyday. It started to creep me out. I didnt really know what to do. I tried responding later than usual and hoped he would eventually stop. I didnt tell my mom at the time because i was afraid I would upset her. \n\nHe would text me a pic of him and his son asking if his son, my half brother, looked cute. I said yea.. and then he asked if he looked like him. That creeped me out. During this time i havent told anyone. Then he really started to scare me when he sent a heart emoji. Maybe it was an accident? He got all defensive saying oh Im so sorry i didnt mean to send that. I said its alright it was an accident.\n\nThis one last time he texted me late and asked me what i was doing i said i was going to shower. He said aw i wanted to text you and then said ill wait for you. I told him i would take long and he said he would wait for me. Um. ew.. that made me feel really grossed out. Then when i finished showering he said r u done? I couldnt accompany you in the shower, ill accompany you while you dry your hair. Bro my heart just kept sinking. I really started feeling gross so i js tried to get him to stop and told him i was going to sleep. He said goodnight and sent a kissy face. Are u srs. He literally got all defensive a  few days ago for js sending a heart n now he thought it was okay to send that. Then he asked if i liked talking to him. I said uh sure and then he said i love talking to you. Bro. THEN HE SAID i wish i could talk to you all the time. I wanted to die right there. I did not respond. Later he sent texts saying can i ask you a question. I left him on delivered. Then he said rest well mi ni\u00f1a which is my girl in spanish (We were talking in spanish which is why i didnt show most of the texts). I gave him no response. Then he asked, did you fall asleep my girl?  Then he later texted, sleep well, dont show these texts to anyone, sweet dreams. I wanted to throw up. \n\nThe next day i decided i would show my older sister the texts. I thought maybe js maybe he texted her too . Maybe he just wanted to get to know us. No he didnt. He actually NEVER texted her. My sister immediately said to not text him again and that he was extremely weird and was giving pedo vibes. I thought maybe i would tell my mom and she would understand and leave him. my sister thought she wouldnt. I really had hope that she would. \n\nI told my mom a couple days later that her husband was texting me and that it was making me uncomfortable. She said, Oh i told him not to be texting you. Thats strange. Why does she need to tell him that.. She told me she would tell him to stop. The next few weeks he would text me hi, hello, Hi (my name) why havent you texted me. And finally he asked me are you ignoring me. He even texted me in instagram. I wasnt even following him on there. I told my mom that it wasnt changing anything and her excuse for all the things he said were that he was drunk and when he gets like that he gets emotional. bro. \n\nI guess my mood was obvious that there was something wrong because then my dad took me to get starbucks which was really him asking me what was wrong. I couldnt hold it in and i told him everything that happened he was disgusted and asked what my mom had done to stop it. when i told him she had basically done nothing to stop it, he called her and spoke to her directly asking her if she thought those messages were appropriate. At this moment my view on my mom changed. She said that nothing happened and that they were js messages and that if they were making me uncomfortable that i shouldve stopped texting him. I started bawling. My dad comforted me and said that going to my moms wasnt going to be allowed anymore. \n\nAfter that my mom texted me asking why i told him. I asked her if she really didnt think anything was wrong with the texts. She said no and said i was overreacting. She asked me if i ever felt uncomfy when i went. But this only barely happened and i didnt see him after the texts were exchanged so no. She dismissed the whole thing. I felt the worst i had ever felt at that moment. I truly did believe my mom would defend me but she didnt. I believed that it was my fault and that i shouldnt have kept texting him. Sometimes i still do believe that. \n\nNow maybe a year from that my mom said she broke up with him for other reasons not becaude of the messages and said she would be better for me and my siblings. A few weeks later she got back with him and the way she told me was by saying guess what! Im back with him and changed the topic immediately after. \n\nI dont see my mom anymore but during facetimes i do hear his voice and it genuinely brings shivers to my spine. Nothing physical happened but it was gross. My dad ended up reporting him to the police but since it never led to anything they werent able to do anything. It genuinely hurts that she didnt see anything wrong with it. It got so bad to feel that my mom shut me out that i started getting really bad anxiety and depression. It was so hard. I really dont know if i was overreacting maybe i was but it everything that happened makes me feel ill and i feel guilt that i ruined my moms and our relationship. Because of me my sisters dont get to see her and I dont know how to feel. My mom always asks when are you guys coming to visit. But i genuinely dont think I could with him being there. ",

She was my best friend and someone I relied on to support, encourage and accompany me through hard times and I was the same to her.\r\n\r\nSo,  after  diagnosis  last   May she  took  off  the  rest  of  the  school  year  because  she  is  a  teacher.  She  only  had  a  few  weeks  left  before  summer  break  anyway.  So,  through  out  the  summer  she  was  holding  things  down  for  me,  up  until  she  had  to  go  back  to  work  in  August.  At  that  time  I  was  able  to  stand  but  not  walking,  and  I  couldn't  feed  myself  or  do  hygiene  stuff,  anyway  we  needed  someone  to  come  and  help  out  during  the  day.  God  sent  one  of  my  cousins  to  help.  He  stayed  with  us  and  did  everything,  showers,  cooking  meals  and  being  an  overall  emotional  support for me while she was at work. He  does  it  out  of  the  kindness  of  his  heart  and  never  ask  to  get  paid.  Months  past  while  declining  in  strength  in  hands,  legs  and  my  back.  During  that  time she  would  do  her  thing,  groceries  shopping,  paying  bills  and cooking  dinner.  Ok, between August and December they would bump heads over petty things, you can tell she knew we needed him but she didn't want him there. Her and I had some unpleasant moments and in my defense i was frustrated and irritated due to my condition and to be real sometimes she would very inpatient with me which would piss me off. So all this is brewing up with all the rest of the stuff going in the world. On January 7th she an argument with him about him playing Playstation all day and not helping, eating her food and blah blah blah, she called him a bitch and pretty much that was it. she told him to get out her house and take me  with him because she can't take care of me  by herself.\r\n\r\nOkay,   now   for   the   twist.   After   being   kicked   out   spouse   and   I   stayed   together.   My   cousin   and   I   relocated   to   las   Vegas   ( I   lived   in   California)   to   his   brother's   house.   While   living   there   she   never   came   to   visit   but   took   a   couple   of   trips   back   for   other   reasons   than   just   to   her.   It's   important   to   know   I   use   a   talking   software   on   an   iPad   equipped   with   eye   tracking   technology   so   I   haven't   talked   to   her   over   the   phone   with   a   clear   voice   since   the   end   of   2024.   So,   we   would   talk   via   text   mostly   casual   topics   and   occasional   when   I   tried   to   convince   her   to   let   me   come   home.   That   is   when   she   started   revealing   why   she   is   being   this   way.   She   starts   telling   me   I'm   not   the   same   person,   I've   changed   and   she   felt   like   she   was   walking   on   eggshells.   She   told   me   I   was   remainder   her   living   with   her   abusive   baby   daddy   she   was   with   for   8   years.   Okay,   then   she   tells   me   I   would   say   mean   things   that   hurt   her.   Basically,   things   between   us   became   degraded   and   all   of   a   sudden   I'm   not   the   loving   man   she   knew.   So,   we   would   go   back   and   forth   about   her   being   right   and   me   being   wrong.   I   was   falling   into   a   depression   and   embarrassment   for   being   kicked   out   our   home,   being   away   from   my   step   daughters   and   only   thing   on   my   body   I   can   control   is   my   neck,   eyes   and   torso   (leaning   up   and   side   to   side).   After   all   this,   and   not   making   love   to   her   for   months   because   her   excuse   was   too   people   in   the   house,   what   about   the   girls   and   your   cousin,   I   still   was   in   love   with   her.   She   would   help   me   out   with   my   medical   needs   like   talking   to   the   doctor's   office,   providing   products   I   could   use   and   I   helped   with   the   password   to   the   Wi-Fi   and   other   ground   keeping   questions   she   had   around   the   house.   Sometimes   we   days   without   texting.   Sometimes   I   was   like   fuc*   it   and   left   her   alone   but   when   she   went   half   way   from   Southern   California ,   High   Desert   area,   to   Las   Vegas   which   is   like   Baker,   on   valentine's   day   I   was   crushed   because   I   was   counting   her   to   show   that initiative to me yes we're going through a storm but love hasn't and she cares for deeply and that she wants me, to hug and kiss me and watch a movie or something. But she told me I should have reminded her to come see me in Vegas. Alright, say less because the family week my cousin and I moved back to California to stay our granny's house because she believes she can help me beat ALS with help from God. So, my thinking was now my spouse distance between me and her shorten to 45 to an hour depending on the day. She did show up a few times when it was convenient for her. I've been in Moreno Valley since February 20th and I seen her four times up until now April 1st. \r\n\r\nSo,  her  last  visit  was  last  Wednesday  26th,  which  started  off  wonderful.  She  bought  me  my  favorite  dish  from  my  favorite  Thai  restaurant,  feed  it  to  me,  cool.  This  is  how  must  of  the  visit  were.  They  are  short  to  because  her  and  my  cousin  hasn't  talked  to  each  other  since  January  8th,  so  it's  cringe  and  awkward  when  their  around  each  other  and  that  is  the  reason  why  I  don't  come  to  visit  at  our  house  up  the  hill.  Anyway,  she  started  showing  me  videos  on  her  phone  about  her  and  my  step  daughter's  trip  to  Legoland.  I'm  watching  the  video  and  she  gets  a  call  from  a  name  listed  as  Will,  she  didn't  answer.  I  examined  the  look  on  her  face.  They  call again   and  didn't  answer.  Now  I'm  like  dang  why  not.  I  don't  everyone  she  knows  but  she  always  answered  phone  call  in  front  of  me  unless  was  a  scam  likely  or  whatever.  This  is  where  my  suspicion  meet  reality  and  I  drop  my  head  show  her  that  I'm  no  longer  interested  in  your  video.  At  the  time  I  was  facing  her  with  my  wheelchair  turned  her  direction  because  usually  parked  in  front  of  my  iPad.  I  told  I  asked  my  cousin  to  turn  me  in  front  of  my  iPad.  I  typed \"please  leave\".  She  said\"before  you  get  all  crazy,  it's  a  friend  of  (her  daughter's  name)  from  school.  Okay,  it's  1:  52p  on  a  Wednesday  (she  is  a  teacher  and  was  on  spring  break,  so  I  almost  fell  for  it).  I  typed\"call  him  back\".  She refused and said\"I'm not going to have this conversation in front of him\". In front of who I thought to myself, my cousin or the teenage boy? At the moment I went deep into my feelings and thought about a lot of events that happened, the sequence of the whole eviction and how she can go days without checking on me and wondering who has been gassing her (especially the way she would come at my cousin and his mom, like calling them out their name). Next thing I do is type\"I hate you. . . Forever\". She read it and didn't react at all. I never talked to her that way, and she didn't cry or slap me. She said I know you do, you been talking to me that way for months\". I'm like\"right that is what I do, disrespect the love of my life. \"in my head. So, she leaves, after trying to kiss my head and tell me it's nothing and that she loves me. Alright, she loves me? Let us see. I FaceTime her as she was getting in her car. She answered, and goes\"what do you want? I told you the truth. I'm not doing this with you. I'm driving! \". I'm asking her over and over again. She not letting up. Double downs. Triple down. This went on the rest of the day which lead to our usual talks about why I'm mean to her and going to give her a nervous breakdown.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe   reason   why   I   left   it   alone   that   day   is   because   I   told   her   I   will   ask   her   daughter   and   she   go   ahead.   I   told   her   I   did   already   (which   is   a   lie)   and   she   well   as   if   our   daughter   confirmed   her   story.   I   didn't   want   to   involve   the   kids   so   I   didn't   ask   her.   Plus   our   daughter   has   her   own   phone,   no   one   calls   her   mom's   phone   for   her. I left it alone all day Thursday and Friday. We talked normal and I pretended she wasn't a liar. Friday she and the girls went drove to Arizona, spontaneous action she called it. Her bother lives out there and it was his wife birthday. They went to dinner all as a family but afterwards the adults went to the casino. I decided to ask her daughter anyway. I texted her\"who is will? Minutes later my spouse text\"why are you texting her, she doesn't know what your talking about\". Alright, boom! Lies! Left alone and went to bed. Saturday morning I got up determined to get my answer. I logged into the Verizon account and went to the usage details for her number and back to Wednesday around the time of the call. Ah! Found the number, but it wasn't a California number but a 605 area code. This number was everywhere on list. Morning , noon and night. Here is the screenshot of confession https://i.postimg.cc/kXDmg9bF/IMG-0182.jpg And I also went back in call history and found the number began showing up in August. \r\n\r\n",

We live 2hrs apart, so I spend roughly half my week with him and half at home - give or take. \nHe can be rather abrasive at times, a lot of little digs and jabs that at times are genuinely hurtful. I tell him in the moment that it hurt my feelings and it\u2019s typically swept under the rug.\nTonight he made dinner and we sat down to eat. I was eating all of my food with a fork and the following conversation ensued (not verbatim, this is to the best of my recollection):\nHim: why are you using a fork?\nMe: idk I prefer it I guess\nHim: just pick it up and eat it with your hands \nMe: but I don\u2019t want to, why does it even matter?\nHim: If a chef made you a meal and told you there was a specific way to eat it, would you not eat it that way?\nMe: I mean, probably not if it wasn\u2019t what I wanted. It depends.\nHim: The chef would make you leave\nMe: meh, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019d leave\nHim: then theres the door, leave.\nMe: (laughs thinking it\u2019s a joke) what why lol\nHim: because it\u2019s disrespectful. Are you gonna keep using the fork?\nMe: uhhh yeah. That\u2019s how I\u2019d prefer to eat it. \nHim: then you can just go\nMe: \u2026.really? You want me to leave?\nHim: yes, *effing leave. There\u2019s the door. Byeeeee\nMe: are you serious right now?\nHim: if you\u2019re not going to eat with your hands like a normal person, then leave.\nMe: whelp. Okay then.\n\nSo I went upstairs and packed my stuff. His daughter came up within 10 minutes to say he was just joking. I said I don\u2019t think it was a joke or something to joke about. I continued to pack and left without any words said between us. Within minutes of leaving, I get the following texts:\nAIO?

It's not about being 'just willing to go.' That's not reflective of anything other than being told to leave. The other option being to refuse, and put myself in a position where my company's unwanted. Pass.

I'll take responsibility but you also know up and leaving wasn't the right decision there. I'm not going to tell you to stay when you decide to leave that is your choice and I'm not going to stop you from doing what you choose if that is how you feel. I'll take the blame but I feel like there's a clearly bigger issue if you are so willing to leave. If you asked me to leave I surely would've had time to make sure stuff was ok before actually going.

There was plenty of room there for you to say no, and plenty of room for me to reevaluate it to ensure I wasn't just reacting or reading it wrong. If you get how that's perceived on my end.

I was joking.\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Speaker B\", \"text\": \"Your tone of voice was raised and abrasive. If 'angry' isn't the right word then fine, but please don't substitute it. I'm not trying to tell you how you feel when you said it. I'm merely conveying how your words impacted me. Which should be vitally important to want to understand in a conversation. You don't have to agree with my perception to validate/empathize/understand idetc. I told you it was hurtful and scary because those are the feelings that were invoked. The agreeing on whether or not and feelings are justified are null and unimportant to it. If you said to me 'they did xyz and I felt this,' I'd respond with a simple apology saying it wasn't my intention, I don't want you to make sure I try to understand where you're coming from, and make sure it didn't happen again. But I wouldn't brush you off by minimizing it as a joke and then defending my stance on it because defensiveness closes the door on a healthy discussion. None of it reflects how much how little you mean to me. That's a totally separate thing that's going off of a presumption instead of asking. I told you the reason I left was because I was told to go, not once, but three times, with an increased intensity. If you didn't actually mean it, you'd have said something in the 10 minutes I was upstairs packing stuff up. 'That' would have been the time to come up and explain that you didn't mean it.

        "Background": "Very long story short (even though this is still long), my ex is from out of state, we met when I lived there and I moved back home, we\u2019d been struggling with long distance so were making plans for him to move to me. He planned a visit to come do an interview, but prior to that visit we got into a fight and he lost his mind, I didn\u2019t think he was still coming to visit.. but he did..\n\nThis brought out a week-long drunken verbal/emotional harassment \u201cvisit\u201d that ended in me breaking up with him and he went back to his home state. He continued to try to call me and text me, I would only respond sporadically through text to leave me alone. \n\nA few weeks later he told me during that manic week, he did in fact take the job and was still planning to move here to try to prove how much I meant to him and win me back even when I told him to stay home. He did come back, he moved in with a \u201cfriend\u201d who lives 6 minutes down the street.\n\nFor the last few months he\u2019s continued to try to contact me. I made the mistake of meeting up with him once, in public at a park, to \u201cfind closure\u201d because I stupidly thought that would help/work.\n\nSince that day, almost two months ago, I\u2019ve blocked over 5 numbers (which I figured out he can keep creating with an app) and 2 emails (which I learn only go to my spam folder). There\u2019s moments where I don\u2019t hear from him and can ignore his emails going to my spam folder, but last night he was at it again..\n\nCalling me from a no caller ID number that I can\u2019t block, leaving me drunk voicemails. Now he\u2019s texting me from another new number, he just \u201cwants to talk\u201d, I know that\u2019s not a good idea.. \n\nUnfortunately he knows where I live, but I moved upstairs, installed a ring camera and have two exits to \u201cescape\u201d from if needed. I don\u2019t want to be ignorant in thinking he won\u2019t hurt me, I don\u2019t think he will, he\u2019s never been violent, his word are his weapons.. I\u2019m trying to just ignore his efforts to contact me, I\u2019m not sure what else to do. My therapist and doctor say to file a restraining order, I\u2019m scared it will ramp things up worse\u2026 is that the only last option? Is there something else I can do before going to the police?",

        "Background": "Before I get into this, a little background and explanation of the property I live on will help this story make the most sense. (I made a janky little layout map of my complex to hopefully help this all make sense) I (32f) moved out to a small town nearly 4 years ago into what we out here call \u201capartments\u201d but they are actually just houses/buildings that have been made into two separate living spaces, or in my case an \u201cL\u201d shaped building split into 3 apartments. The small part of the \u201cL\u201d is my apartment. The corner and up 1/3 of the long side of the \u201cL\u201d is the second apartment and then the rest of the \u201cL\u201d is the third apartment, and on the front side of that third apartment is a garage with 4 parking bays.  \n\nOn this property there is a house towards the road, a \u201cU\u201d shaped driveway that starts on one side of the house goes around the back of the house and up to the other side.  My building is on the backside of the driveway.  My kitchen window and front door are facing the driveway which gives my doorbell camera a great view of the driveway, the garages and all of our vehicles since none of us park in our garage. \n\nIf looking out my kitchen window, the neighbor in the corner apartment is to the left of me so typically any time they get in or out of their vehicles my doorbell camera catches it. Over the years my camera has caught tons of things that have made people question why I still live here or just things people were shocked I caught on camera. I have caught a drunk neighbor throwing a fit and smashing someone\u2019s camera in front of our landlord because he thought we were \u201cwatching him\u201d. I\u2019ve caught detectives and sheriffs rolling up tac vests and all looking for a neighbors son who was wanted in multiple counties. Caught another neighbor trying to run from a sheriffs deputy and instead getting tased in the driveway. And can\u2019t forget the numerous videos of a previous neighbors pigeons just roaming around the driveway setting off my camera every 5 mins haha!  My phone is filled with crazy videos from my doorbell camera so clearly I am no stranger to \u201codd\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d things happening around me, nor do I let any of it bother me. Usually.  \n\nOver the last 6-8 months or so my neighbors in the corner (older male and female couple not married we will call the male A and the female K) have had another person living with them, a male, late 30\u2019s early 40\u2019s. Since I truly don\u2019t even know his name we shall call him Fred (I think he is the son of A). \n\nWhen Fred started living here, he seemed very quiet and just kept to himself. Soon I noticed he seemed as if he would hide from me if we ended up in the driveway at the same time. I walked out of my apartment just as he was about to get out of the car, he stopped what he was doing and sat there and waited until I was in my truck so he could get out of the car.  I have never spoken to this man, not even so much as a neighborly \u201cHi\u201d or even a half assed smile. I thought it was weird but just minded my business. I try to keep to myself around here. \n\nThe other morning when I woke up around 6:30 am, I noticed my door camera had gone off quite a bit starting just before 4 am. The videos started with Fred getting home in a car I\u2019ve never seen before, but not uncommon, nor is that any part of the problem, but it sounded like there was two people talking when he got out of the car. There\u2019s then a video of Fred walking along all of the cars and toward his front door and you can hear him say \u201cI\u2019ve got people in there dude\u201d. So again I just thought someone else was with him and my camera just didn\u2019t catch them walking to the door. \n\nThis is when things started to get super weird. The next video he just walks into frame and is kinda just standing there not saying anything.  He then leans forward like he\u2019s looking at something making some weird face and says \u201cwow you are funny looking you know that?\u201d  There is absolutely nothing and nobody in front of him.  He then starts talking in what I can only describe as gibberish. Then goes on saying \u201cwhat\u2019s this? Nothing good.  Destroy!\u201d\n\nThe next 6 videos which span over an hour and fifteen mins or so are just Fred walking around back and forth. From the apartment to the dumpster with a bag of garbage stopping between cars to say something about \u201cnot being able to follow f-ing directions\u201d and then walking on and saying something about pillows and then walking back to the apartment stopping between cars for a few seconds mumbling something else before walking toward the door again. He then appears again, stands there for a second and then just nonchalantly walks down the driveway and disappeared into the darkness. After a couple mins my camera picked him up coming across the  driveway from the other side which was when he went inside and that was the last I saw of him (around 5:15 am). Some time before 8:30 the car he showed up in disappeared and my camera never caught who left in it. \n\nI showed my landlord a couple of the videos and he at first questioned if maybe Fred was just trying to mess with me. That is something I questioned myself, but over an hour of walking around and mumbling in the cold at 4 am would be some major dedication for pranking or messing with me. \n\nAfter talking to my landlord, I went back through my cameras videos, going back at least 2 weeks and I ended up finding more videos of Fred, not necessarily talking to himself like the videos from the other morning, but they were definitely odd I guess.  Videos of him walking by my door and you can see him side eyeing my apartment/camera/door whatever and then as he\u2019s walking away across the driveway toward the dumpster, he turns around is looking back at my door. In another video he walked up along the passenger side of the car he was driving, walked around the front and to the drivers side to get in, stopped for a moment and just dead stares at my camera. He easily could have walked behind the car and up the drivers side to get in the car. \n\nIn no way am I saying he is not allowed to simply walk by my front door and look at it or look at my camera, but there now seems to be multiple videos of him intentionally walking or standing directly in front of my camera. Directly looking into it. In one video he walked by completely normal, and then when walking back he covered his face as if to hide from the camera. Typically I wouldn\u2019t think anything of most of this because it\u2019s just me and I try to keep to myself and weird stuff happens, that\u2019s just life but not usually like this.  The I see things is it\u2019s not all about me you know?  \n\nI don\u2019t know if I really described situations well enough or described enough situations to give a good enough idea of these \u201cevents\u201d because if I went into full detail y\u2019all would be sitting here all day reading, but am I crazy to think my neighbor is messing with me?  Is this possibly just Fred on drugs? Or schizophrenic? Thoughts?? Help?? ",

It\u2019s also important to note that I never raise my voice at him and just ask that he stop this, but he always accuses me of yelling at him or having a dramatic reaction. Whenever we fight, he\u2019s the one that yells and I maintain an even tone to not antagonize him further.

My dad shared the news with his friend \"J\" (71M). J and my dad have been friends since they were in their 20s; J has seen me in diapers. J has always been crude and inappropriate, but his behavior has gotten so much worse and creepier over the years. In the past, he used to make me uncomfortable with sexual jokes and remarks about my mom. Then he started making sexual jokes about me. But only lately has he been implying sexual things between me and J.\r\n\r\nJ also constantly belittles my husband, even to my husband's face, but fortunately my husband has thick skin and these jabs don't get to him. J believes in traditional gender roles, and in my marriage, I am the breadwinner and my husband does more \"domestic\" things around the house. This arrangement works for us, and we are very happy.\r\n\r\nI'm not in the business of ruining decades-long friendships, but enough is enough. I sent my dad screenshots of my latest conversation with J. My dad is on my side and taking it seriously, and he plans on having a discussion with J later today. However, he also told me that he doesn't think anything will come of the conversation as this is just J's sense of humor. I'd also love to share these screenshots with J's wife, but unfortunately I do not have her phone number. AIO?",
