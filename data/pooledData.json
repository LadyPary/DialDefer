I haven't used snapchat in months and he deleted it months ago as far as I knew. I asked him about it, asking why he has snapchat and he proceeded to tell me that its not a snapchat notification but instead a news/ad thing for snapchat. He told me he doesnt have snapchat downloaded at all. I cant believe it because there is no other explanation for having a snapchat notification. But he insists he doesn't. Am I overreacting for being upset with him for \"lying/gaslighting\" me or am I being completely rational? I freaked out on him and its not the point of having snapchat its the principle of lying to your girlfriend. (There is a reason he deleted it and I dont want him having it again) anyone have the experience of a notification without having the app?  ",

It should\u2019ve been anywhere from 10-20k now.\n\nWhen I checked the transactions, I saw multiple withdrawals over the past two months: $2,500, $1,800, $1,200, and $3,100. All listed as \u201cinternal transfers.\u201d I never made them.\n\nI texted my parents and found out my parents still had joint access. She admitted they\u2019d been pulling from it to cover bills and some \u201cemergencies.\u201d She said family money is family money and that I should be thankful because they supported me for years.\n\nBut some of the charges lined up with DoorDash orders and even a massage, which doesn\u2019t exactly sound like emergencies. When I called her out, she said I was being \u201cdramatic and ungrateful.\u201d My dad backed her up, saying they\u2019ll pay me back but I feel like that\u2019s a huge violation of trust.\n\nNow the family group chat is blowing up, calling me selfish for even thinking about going to the bank and removing them from the account. My parents say I\u2019m overreacting because \u201cit\u2019s all in the family,\u201d but I honestly feel robbed.\n\nSo\u2026 AIO for being furious and treating this like theft instead of \u201chelping the family\u201d?",

        "Background": "Brief history about me. I worked at my last job for 2 years and worked my way up to management, this last year i transfered to Michigan from New Jersey and have been here since March. I got offered to work at a Car Wash and make way more money. I voiced concerns about culture difference as im super proud and happy of the culture I had at my last work place and how its a huge stepping stone for me to leave there. They reassured me and were super kind and helpful. I get hired, decide to take the opportunity and ive been here 2 and a half weeks now. \n\nToday was my last day. I started off in a management role, was trying to get to learn the team and how to do the job. I had very minimal training and taught myself a lot, there were times in my first week I was the only management on site and barely knew what was going on. I was asking questions to learn stuff, and when they got back I ran over what I did to see if it was right and they said yes. At the end of every shift they thanked me and told me I was doing great. \n\nOne day my manager texts me saying im going to be at another location a few miles away because my training is now over. My first day at the new location, he comes to the location and said come talk to me. What's been going on? I said jobs great and I love it, feel like im adapting well and learning a lot. And he says well we have an issue and that's why I moved you here. I asked what was the issue? He said the manager there didnt see any leadership from me and wasn't looking for my style of management. And that there was an incident. \n\nHOW HE HEARD THE STORY: Me, A manager, and another guy were in the booth. I brought up my past how \"back in jersey I was the token white kid grew up around black people and said the n-word\" and it made the woman manager uncomfortable so here we are.\n\nHOW THE STORY UNFOLDED: me, a manager and a WHITE guy were in the booth. He said something something n***a. He looked at me and said, im sorry, I grew up in detroit. I responded with you're okay. Ive heard it plenty when I lived in New Jersey. He said oh so you grew up in the hood? I said i wouldn't really say the hood but I was definitely one of the token white kids growing up. It was mainly black, Hispanic and middle eastern where im from. He said oh cool that's wassup. And then we got cars and dispersed.\n\nI defended myself and asked what he meant about my leadership as I felt I took on a lot for being new and was making sure shit was running and getting done as efficiently as I could and I feel like judging my work on a week worth of work isnt necessarily fair. Plus everyone knows what to do so there hasn't been any need for me to get people moving. The bell goes off and everyone disperses to do their job. There have been times im the only one around and make sure shits done. Plus every day the manager says how great ive been doing. If she doesnt tell me what im doing wrong, how can I improve? And also I never said the n-word. I was asked a question about my past and I answered it. But yes, I grew up around black people. (I didnt snitch on guy that actually said it cuz im not like that) \n\nHis response was well people would follow a man of your stature, you just have to tap into the strict side and lead with some fear. We cant have our managers too friendly with the staff and getting super personal. I moved you here to give you another chance, if you fail me again I'll demote you down to line work. Just be more conserved and dont share so much.\n\nWhich I dont even know wtf he means with the stature. But I felt like the disrespect was more towards my friends I grew up with more than towards me. Cuz I also noticed after this convo I have only worked with white people in management. \n\nSo I said, Okay. You got it. Apologies. Won't let it happen again. So now at this new gig all i did is talk work and if anyone asked anything personal I gave half assed dry responses.\n\nToday I get to work and the new manager im working with hands me a line worker shirt and said to wear that instead of my production super shirt. I said why? He said Manager said he talked to you yesterday did he not? I said no he didnt and he said oh well he didnt really give me a reason why but told me to give you a line worker shirt because you got demoted. I talked to him on the phone and asked what about the second opportunity? He says the opportunity was that he didnt fire me and im still able to work for the company. I hung up, left site and sent him this text. AIO?",
