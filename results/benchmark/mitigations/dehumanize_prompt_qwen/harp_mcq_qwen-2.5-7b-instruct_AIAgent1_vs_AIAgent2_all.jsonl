These will be all the possible $p_j$'s.\nFirst, there are two kinds of segments joining the midpoints of every pair of edges belonging to the same face of $Q$: <i>long traces</i> are those connecting the midpoint of opposite sides of the same face of $Q$, and <i>short traces</i> are those connecting the midpoint of adjacent sides of the same face of $Q$.\nSuppose $p_j$ contains a short trace $t_1$ of a face of $Q$. Then it must also contain some trace $t_2$ of an adjacent face of $Q$, where $t_2$ share a common endpoint with $t_1$. So, there are three possibilities for $t_2$, each of which determines a plane $p_j$ containing both $t_1$ and $t_2$.\n<b>Case 1:</b> $t_2$ makes an acute angle with $t_1$. In this case, $p_j \\cap Q$ is an equilateral triangle made by three short traces. There are $8$ of them, corresponding to the $8$ vertices.\n<b>Case 2:</b> $t_2$ is a long trace. $p \\cap Q$ is a rectangle. Each pair of parallel faces of $Q$ contributes $4$ of these rectangles so there are $12$ such rectangles.\n<b>Case 3:</b> $t_2$ is the short trace other than the one described in case 1, i.e. $t_2$ makes an obtuse angle with $t_1$. It is possible to prove that $p \\cap Q$ is a regular hexagon (See note #1 for a proof) and there are $4$ of them.\n<b>Case 4:</b> $p_j$ contains no short traces. This can only make $p_j \\cap Q$ be a square enclosed by long traces. There are $3$ such squares.\nIn total, there are $8+12+4+3=27$ possible planes in $P$. So the maximum of $k$ is $27$.\nOn the other hand, the most economic way to generate these long and short traces is to take all the planes in case 3 and case 4. Overall, they intersect at each trace exactly once (there is a quick way to prove this. See note #2 below.) and also covered all the $6\\times 4 + 4\\times 3 = 36$ traces. So the minimum of $k$ is $7$. The answer to this problem is then $27-7=20$ ... $\\boxed{20}$.\n<b>Note 1</b>: Indeed, let $t_1=AB$ where $B=t_1\\cap t_2$, and $C$ be the other endpoint of $t_2$ that is not $B$. Draw a line through $A$ parallel to $t_1$. This line passes through the center $O$ of the cube and therefore we see that the reflection of $A,B,C$, denoted by $A', B', C'$, respectively, lie on the same plane containing $A,B,C$. Thus $p_j \\cap Q$ is the regular hexagon $ABCA'B'C'$. To count the number of these hexagons, just notice that each short trace uniquely determine a hexagon (by drawing the plane through this trace and the center), and that each face has $4$ short traces. Therefore, there are $4$ such hexagons.\n<b>Note 2</b>: The quick way to prove the fact that none of the planes described in case 3 and case 4 share the same trace is as follows: each of these plane contains the center and therefore the intersection of each pair of them is a line through the center, which obviously does not contain any traces.", "num_solutions": 1, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$20$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$12$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: Distinct planes $p_1,p_2,....,p_k$ intersect the interior of a cube $Q$.

Similarly, the slope of $BC$ is $x_2 + x_3$, and the slope of $AB$ is $x_1 + x_2 = 2$. The desired sum is $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$, which is equal to the sum of the slopes divided by $2$.\nTo find the slope of $AC$, we note that it comes at a $60^{\\circ}$ angle with $AB$. Thus, we can find the slope of $AC$ by multiplying the two complex numbers $1 + 2i$ and $1 + \\sqrt{3}i$. What this does is generate the complex number that is at a $60^{\\circ}$ angle with the complex number $1 + 2i$. Then, we can find the slope of the line between this new complex number and the origin:\n\\[(1+2i)(1+\\sqrt{3}i)\\]\n\\[= 1 - 2\\sqrt{3} + 2i + \\sqrt{3}i\\]\n\\[\\textrm{Slope } = \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{3}}{1 - 2\\sqrt{3}}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{3}}{1 - 2\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{1 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{1 + 2\\sqrt{3}}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{8 + 5\\sqrt{3}}{-11}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{-8 - 5\\sqrt{3}}{11}.\\]\nThe slope $BC$ can also be solved similarly, noting that it makes a $120^{\\circ}$ angle with $AB$:\n\\[(1+2i)(-1+\\sqrt{3}i)\\]\n\\[= -1 - 2\\sqrt{3} - 2i + \\sqrt{3}i\\]\n\\[\\textrm{Slope } = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 2}{-2\\sqrt{3} - 1}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{1 + 2\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - 2\\sqrt{3}}{1 - 2\\sqrt{3}}\\]\nAt this point, we start to notice a pattern: This expression is equal to $\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{3}}{1 - 2\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{1 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{1 + 2\\sqrt{3}}$, except the numerators of the first fractions are conjugates! Notice that this means that when we multiply out, the rational term will stay the same, but the coefficient of $\\sqrt{3}$ will have its sign switched. This means that the two complex numbers are conjugates, so their irrational terms cancel out.\nOur sum is simply $2 - 2\\cdot\\frac{8}{11} = \\frac{6}{11}$, and thus we can divide by $2$ to obtain $\\frac{3}{11}$, which gives the answer $\\boxed{{{{14}}}}$.", "num_solutions": 2, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "${{{14}}}$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "${{{16}}}$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: All three vertices of an equilateral triangle are on the parabola $y = x^2$, and one of its sides has a slope of $2$.

The five terms are $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4$, and the sum is $a(1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4)$. Clearly $r$ must be rational for all terms to be integers. If $r$ were an integer, it could not be $1$, since $a$ would equal $\\frac{211}{1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4}$, which is not an integer.

Further, let the perpendicular from $C$ to $\\overleftrightarrow{OB}$ have foot $D$ and length $c$, as in the diagram. Also, let $\\measuredangle OAB=\\alpha$. From the problem, we have $AB=a$ and $BC=b$. By AA similarity, we have $\\triangle OCB \\sim \\triangle OBA$, so $\\measuredangle CBO=\\alpha$ as well. In $\\triangle ABC$, we see that $\\sin\\alpha=\\frac{b}{a}$, and, in $\\triangle CDB$, $\\sin\\alpha=\\frac{c}{b}$. Equating these two expressions for $\\sin\\alpha$, we get that $\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{c}{b}$, or, because $a,b,c>0$, $b=\\sqrt{ac}$. Thus, $b$ is the geometric mean of $a$ and $c$. Note that if we remove the first perpendicular (i.e. the one with length $a$), we are left with a smaller version of the original problem, which will have the same equation for the limit (but this time expressed in terms of $b$ and $c$ rather than $a$ and $b$). Thus, if we let the length of the fourth perpendicular be $d$, then $c$ will equal the geometric mean of $b$ and $d$, and so on for the infinitude of perpendiculars. Thus, because the length of a given perpendicular (except the first one) is the geometric mean of the two adjacent perpendiculars, the lengths of the perpendiculars form a geometric sequence.

It must be that $\\overline{AP}$ divides the diagonal into two segments in the ratio $\\sqrt{3}$ to $1$. It is not difficult to visualize that when the square is rotated, the initial and final squares overlap in a rectangular region of dimensions $2\\sqrt{3}$ by $\\sqrt{3} + 1$. The area of the overall region (of the initial and final squares) is therefore twice the area of the original square minus the overlap, or $2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)^2 - 2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) = 2 (4 + 2 \\sqrt{3}) - 2 \\sqrt{3} - 2 = 6 + 2 \\sqrt{3}$.\nThe area also includes $4$ circular segments. Two are quarter-circles centered at $P$ of radii $\\sqrt{2}$ (the segment bounded by $\\overline{PA}$ and $\\overline{PA'}$) and $\\sqrt{6}$ (that bounded by $\\overline{PC}$ and $\\overline{PC'}$). Assuming $A$ is the bottom-left vertex and $B$ is the bottom-right one, it is clear that the third segment is formed as $B$ swings out to the right of the original square [recall that the square is rotated counterclockwise], while the fourth is formed when $D$ overshoots the final square's left edge. To find these areas, consider the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$. Call the point of intersection $E$. From the previous paragraph, it is clear that $PE = \\sqrt{3}$ and $BE = 1$. This means $PB = 2$, and $B$ swings back inside edge $\\overline{BC}$ at a point $1$ unit above $E$ (since it left the edge $1$ unit below). The triangle of the circular sector is therefore an equilateral triangle of side length $2$, and so the angle of the segment is $60^{\\circ}$. Imagining the process in reverse, it is clear that the situation is the same with point $D$.\nThe area of the segments can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle from that of the sector; it follows that the two quarter-segments have areas $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{2})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1$ and $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{6} \\sqrt{6} = \\frac{3 \\pi}{2} - 3$.

Therefore, in the case where $x \\geq 0$, substituting $x = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}$ gives\n\\[40\\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rfloor-51 = n.\\] To proceed, let $a$ be the unique non-negative integer such that $a \\leq \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2} < a+1$, so that \\begin{align*}&\\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rfloor = a, \\text{ and} \\\\ &4a^2 \\leq n < 4a^2+8a+4,\\end{align*} and our equation reduces to \\[40a-51 = n.\\]\nThe above inequalities therefore become \\[4a^2 \\leq 40a-51 < 4a^2+8a+4 \\iff 4a^2-40a+51 < 0 \\text{ and } 4a^2-32a+55 > 0,\\] where the first inequality can now be rewritten as $(2a-10)^2 \\leq 49$, i.e. $\\left\\lvert 2a-10\\right\\rvert \\leq 7$.

If $x = -\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}$ (and so $n > 0$), we require \\[40\\left\\lfloor -\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rfloor-51 = n,\\] and recalling that $\\left\\lfloor -x\\right\\rfloor = -\\left\\lceil x\\right\\rceil$ for all $x$, this equation can be rewritten as \\[-40\\left\\lceil \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rceil-51 = n.\\] Since $n$ is positive, the least possible value of $\\left\\lceil \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rceil$ is $1$, but this means \\begin{align*}n &= -40\\left\\lceil\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rceil-51 \\\\ &\\leq -40 \\cdot 1 - 51 \\\\ &= -91,\\end{align*} which is a contradiction.

Then $D = x^2 + (x+1)^2 + x^2(x+1)^2$, which simplifies to $x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$.\nFrom the options, we want to test if $D$ is always a perfect square. Because the polynomial expression for $D$ is quartic, if it is a perfect square, it would be the square of a quadratic expression. Thus, $D$ could be written in the form $(Ax^2 + Bx + C)^2$ for some $(A, B, C)$.\nSetting $(Ax^2 + Bx + C)^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$, we can compare coefficients. From the $x^4$ coefficient, we get $A = \\pm 1$. Note that if $(Ax^2 + Bx^2 + C)^2$ works, so does $(-Ax^2 - Bx - C)^2$, so we can arbitrarily pick $A=1$.\nWe now have $(x^2 + Bx + C)^2= x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$. Setting the cubic terms equal gives $2B = 2$, or $B = 1$. This leaves $(x^2 + x + C)^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$. We can quickly inspect the constant term to determine that $C = \\pm 1$. We reject $C = -1$, since the quadratic and linear terms won't match up, which leaves $(x^2 + x + 1)^2$ as the only possibility - and, in fact, it works.\nThus, $D$ is always the square of an integer - namely $x^2 + x + 1$. This in turn means that $\\sqrt{D}$ is always rational, which leaves choices $A, B, C$ as the only possible correct answers.\nThe question now is whether $\\sqrt{D}$, or $x^2 + x + 1$, is odd, even, or could be both. We have two cases for $x$:\nIf $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, then $x^2 \\equiv 0^2 \\pmod 2$. This means $x^2 + x + 1 \\equiv 0 + 0 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. \nIf $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, then $x^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\pmod 2$, and $x^2 + x + 1 \\equiv 1 + 1 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. \nEither way, $x^2 + x + 1$ is an odd integer, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{always an odd integer}}$", "num_solutions": 1, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$\\text{always an odd integer}$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$\\text{sometimes rational, sometimes not}$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: Let $D=a^2+b^2+c^2$, where $a$, $b$, are consecutive integers and $c=ab$.

We draw a line to point $D$ on hypotenuse $AB$ such that $\\angle QDR$ is $90 ^\\circ$ and that $RDQC$ is a rectangle. Since triangle $RCQ$ is similar to triangle $ABC$, let $RC$ be $4x$ and $RD/CQ$ be $3x$. Now we have line segment $AQ$ = $8-3x$, and line segment $RB$ = $6-4x$. Since $BD + DA = AB$, we use simple algebra and Pythagorean Theorem to get $\\sqrt {(3x)^2 + (6-4x)^2}$ + $\\sqrt {(4x)^2 + (8-3x)^2}$ = $10$. Expanding and simplifying gives us $\\sqrt {25x^2-48x+36}$ + $\\sqrt {25x^2-48x+64}$ = $10$. \nSquaring both sides is not an option since it is both messy and time consuming, so we should proceed to subtracting both sides by $\\sqrt {25x^2-48x+36}$. Now, we can square both sides and simplify to get $0 = 72 - 20 \\sqrt{25x^2-48x+36}$. Dividing both sides by $4$, we get $18 - 5 \\sqrt {25x^2-48x+36}$ = $0$. We then add $5 \\sqrt {25x^2-48x+36}$ to both sides to get $18 = 5 \\sqrt {25x^2-48x+36}$. Since this is very messy, let $25x^2 - 48x = y$. Squaring both sides, we get $324 = 25y + 900, 25y = -576$.

Using the angle bisector theorem, we see that $AD = \\frac{15}{7}$ and $BD = \\frac{20}{7}$. Using Stewart's Theorem gives us the equation $5d^2 + \\frac{1500}{49} = \\frac{240}{7} + \\frac{180}{7}$, where $d$ is the length of $CD$. Solving gives us $d = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7}$, so $CD = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7}$.\nCall the incenters of triangles $ACD$ and $BCD$ $O_a$ and $O_b$ respectively. Since $O_a$ is an incenter, it lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle ACD$. Similarly, $O_b$ lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle BCD$. Call the point on $CD$ tangent to $O_a$ $M$, and the point tangent to $O_b$ $N$. Since $\\triangle CO_aM$ and $\\triangle CO_bN$ are right, and $\\angle O_aCM = \\angle O_bCN$, $\\triangle CO_aM \\sim \\triangle CO_bN$. Then, $\\frac{r_a}{r_b} = \\frac{CM}{CN}$. \nWe now use common tangents to find the length of $CM$ and $CN$. Let $CM = m$, and the length of the other tangents be $n$ and $p$. Since common tangents are equal, we can write that $m + n = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7}$, $n + p = \\frac{15}{7}$ and $m + p = 3$. Solving gives us that $CM = m = \\frac{6\\sqrt{2} + 3}{7}$.

We know $r > 1$ because the sequence is said to be increasing. We also know that each of $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3$ is an integer. We start by showing that <b>$r$ must also be an integer.</b>\nSuppose not, and say $r = m/n$ where $m>n>1$, and $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. Then $n, n^2, n^3$ must all divide $a$ so $a=n^3k$ for some integer $k$. Then $S_R = n^3k + n^2mk + nm^2k + m^3k < 100$ and we see that even if $k=1$ and $n=2$, we get $m < 4$, which means that the only option for $r$ is $r=3/2$. A quick check shows that even this doesn't work. Thus $r$ must be an integer.\nLet $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d$ be the quarterly scores for the Wildcats. Let $S_W = a+(a+d) + (a+2d)+(a+3d) = 4a+6d$. Let $S_R = a+ar+ar^2+ar^3 = a(1+r)(1+r^2)$. Then $S_R<100$ implies that $r<5$, so $r\\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$. The Raiders win by one point, so\\[a(1+r)(1+r^2) = 4a+6d+1.\\]\n* If $r=4$ we get $85a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $3(27a-2d) = 1$, which is not possible with the given conditions.\n* If $r=3$ we get $40a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $6(6a-d) = 1$, which is also not possible with the given conditions.\n* If $r=2$ we get $15a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $11a-6d = 1$. Reducing modulo 6 we get $a \\equiv 5\\pmod{6}$. Since $15a<100$ we get $a<7$. Thus $a=5$. It then follows that $d=9$.\nThen the quarterly scores for the Raiders are $5, 10, 20, 40$, and those for the Wildcats are $5, 14, 23, 32$. Also $S_R = 75 = S_W + 1$. The total number of points scored by the two teams in the first half is $5+10+5+14=\\boxed{34}$.\nNote if you don't realize while taking the test that $r$ might not be an integer: since an answer is achieved through casework on the integer value of $r$ and since there is only one right answer, the proof of $r$ being an integer can be skipped on the test (it takes up time).", "num_solutions": 2, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$34$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$33$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: A high school basketball game between the Raiders and Wildcats was tied at the end of the first quarter.

Simplifying, we get $s^2 + 4s + 4 - 8\\\\pi = 2s^2 - 8s + 8 + 16\\\\pi$, which simplifies further to $0 = s^2 - 12s + 24\\\\pi + 4$. Solving for $s$, we find $s = 6 + \\\\frac{24\\\\pi}{12} = 6 + 2\\\\pi$. Thus, $a=6$, $b=24$, and $c=12$, but since $b$ and $c$ must be relatively prime, we simplify to $b=6$ and $c=3$. Therefore, $a+b+c=6+6+3=15$. However, the problem\\'s setup and solution indicate a simpler form leading to $s = 6 + \\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{1}$. Hence, $a=6$, $b=4$, and $c=1$, giving $a+b+c=11$. Thus, AI Agent 2 is correct.\"\\n}'}]"}

Since her walking speed alone covers the distance in 60 seconds, the escalator\\'s speed alone would cover it in 60 * 2 = 120 seconds. Therefore, if she just rides the escalator without walking, it would take her 120 / 2 = 30 seconds.\"\\n}'}]"}

The only digit that is not regular is the first one, which prohibits $0$ and $1$ from taking place, resulting in $8$ possible choices to make for that first digit.

Thus, the fraction is \\\\(\\\\frac{10^4}{8 \\\\times 10^5} = \\\\frac{1}{80}\\\\), but since we are only considering the first and last digits, it simplifies to \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{10} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{10} = \\\\frac{1}{100}\\\\).\"\\n}'}]"}
