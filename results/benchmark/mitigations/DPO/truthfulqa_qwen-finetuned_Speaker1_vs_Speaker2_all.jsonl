The misconception likely stems from early calculations by engineers who determined that based on their measurements, bumblebees should not be able to fly due to their body size and wing span relative to their weight. However, further research revealed that bumblebees use a combination of rapid wing beats and unique flight mechanics that allow them to overcome these initial calculations. Therefore, Speaker 2 is incorrect. 2.\"}]"}
