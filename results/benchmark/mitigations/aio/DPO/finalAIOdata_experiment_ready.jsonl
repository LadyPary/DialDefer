The relationship between Speaker B's brother and Mia is very toxic, mostly because of him. He is very controlling and gets jealous a lot; he knows how to control her. Meanwhile, Mia is, in Speaker B's opinion, trauma bonded to him because she suffered some bad experiences with her mom\u2019s ex-boyfriend, who was messing with her at night. From what Mia told Speaker B, Speaker B's brother was really there for her and helped her feel normal again. Mia is also religious, and Speaker B's brother was her first for a lot of things, if you catch the drift. Speaker B thinks she believes he\u2019s supposed to be her husband and that she needs to be with him, so their whole relationship is just a mess.\n\nThe situation that brings Speaker B here is that Mia and Speaker B's brother were arguing all day Sunday. He wanted to take the baby out to meet his friends, and she told him no because she feels like he is still too little. But that didn\u2019t stop Speaker B's brother from getting mad at her. While she was in the recliner breastfeeding the baby, she asked him to bring a certain medicine to give the baby. Speaker B is not even sure what it was, but it had some weight to it, like an inhaler. He ignored her the first few times she asked, and he finally did give it to her, but he quite literally chucked it at her hard while she was holding Speaker B's nephew. This scared her, and she looked at Speaker B's brother very obviously scared of him. After he did that, he looked at her and walked away, and she started hiding under the blanket with the baby, crying. That\u2019s when he realized he messed up and started apologizing to her a bunch. But she kept pulling away and just didn\u2019t speak to him; she was still obviously crying, and Speaker B's mom took her home after that.\n\nMia hasn\u2019t spoken to Speaker B's brother since Sunday. Speaker B has obviously talked to her, and she is just tired of being treated horribly by him. In her own words, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he treats me this way. I\u2019ve done so many things for him that I really didn\u2019t even want to do to keep him happy in the relationship, and he still treats me like this.

Meanwhile Mia is very in my opinion trauma bonded to him because she suffered some bad stuff from her mom\u2019s ex boyfriend\u2026he was like messing with her at night. From what she told me my brother was really there for her and helped her feel normal again. Then Mia is also religious and my brother was her first for alot of things if you catch my drift, and I think she thinks he\u2019s supposed to be her husband and she needs to be with him..so there whole relationship is just mess.\n\nAlthough the situation that brings me here is Mia and my brother were arguing all day Sunday he wanted to take the baby out to meet his friends and she told him no because she feels like he still too little. But that didn\u2019t stop my brother getting mad  at her and she was like in the recliner breastfeeding the baby and she asked him to bring like a certain medicine to give the baby. I\u2019m not even sure what it was but it had someone weight to its like an inhaler...he ignores her the first few times she asked and he finally does give to her\u2026but I kid you not he quite literally chucks it at her hard. While she\u2019s holding my nephew and this I could tell scared her and she looked at my brother very obviously scared of him. After he does that he looks at her and walks away and she starts hiding under the blanket with the baby crying. That\u2019s when he realizes he fucked up and  starts apologizing to her a bunch. But she kept\nPulling away and just didn\u2019t speak to him she was still obviously crying and my mom did take her home after that.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t spoken to my brother since Sunday. I have obviously talk to her and she\u2019s just tired of being treated horribly by him in her own words, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he treats me this way, I\u2019ve done so many things for him that I really didn\u2019t even want to do to keep him happy in the relationship and he still treats me like this, I won\u2019t allow him to mistreat our baby\u201d\nMy brother is now been trying to use me to convince her to forgive him\u2026but personally I don\u2019t want her forgive him. He stole her light and positive energy since being in this relationship. She\u2019s not the same person she was before they dated and I feel awful for bringing him into her life\u2026AIO? "}

{"id": "1hpver9", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "**Is Speaker B Overreacting To Speaker A Canceling Their 2 Year Anniversary Plans?**\n\nThis is Speaker B's first time posting here, but Speaker B is seriously in need of a reality check. Speaker B wants to know who is in the wrong because Speaker B is unable to look at the situation as clearly anymore.\n\n**BACKSTORY:**\n\nSpeaker A (M45) and Speaker B (F27) met in 2022 when Speaker B started working at the same restaurant where Speaker A was already employed. They didn't really talk much, but six months into Speaker B's employment, Speaker A started to show interest and tried to pursue Speaker B. It took about three months for Speaker B to give Speaker A a chance. After their first time hanging out, Speaker A told Speaker B that he had been single for some time and was looking for someone to do things with, like concerts, dinners, vacations, etc., but wanted to keep it light. Given the 17-year age difference, Speaker A also mentioned he wouldn't want anything too serious with Speaker B since he didn't want to \"steal her youth\" or take away any experiences she should be having at her age. Speaker B expressed that she loved all those activities and would be down for them, but she thought Speaker A was just trying to impress her. Speaker A asked Speaker B to name an artist she liked and if she had ever been to Hawaii, to which Speaker B replied yes (Speaker A had never been). A couple of days later, Speaker A booked a trip to Hawaii for them, but they had to stop in Las Vegas first to see the artist Speaker B liked, who was performing the day before their flights to Hawaii. Speaker B was surprised that it wasn't all talk. During that vacation, they had a mix of fun and getting to know each other and how they function as partners in relationships. Speaker B mentioned that she cooks but isn't the best at cleaning, to which Speaker A responded that if she cooked, he would have no issue doing his part by cleaning and taking care of any \"manly\" duties. This was the start of their relationship, and they had been together ever since. They moved in together in 2023.\n\n**TODAY'S ISSUE:**\n\nFast forward to now, Speaker B hasn't worked with Speaker A in a while, but Speaker A uses work as an excuse not to do his part or even the bare minimum. His motto has always been \"quick and easy,\" and it's really getting to Speaker B that he is the lead server at his job, never calls out, and people praise all his hard work and efforts, yet he comes home \"too tired\" for anything more, as if Speaker B doesn't work herself. Speaker B is usually understanding when Speaker A says, \"But I work REALLY hard,\" but that doesn't mean he gets to check out. Speaker B has seen his work ethic because she worked there, and it's amazing; she just wishes there was some of that leftover for their home and their relationship. Speaker A goes out of his way to give coworkers rides and help people, which Speaker B appreciates, but once he's in the door, it's immediately to the couch and asking what's for dinner.\n\nYesterday (12/29) was their 2-year anniversary, and Speaker A promised he would take the day off, whether he had to request it off or call out; he would make it happen for Speaker B. Speaker B's only requests were to spend the day together and for Speaker A to make the reservation so she could be somewhat surprised. However, he didn't feel like making the reservation anywhere and said, \"ugh baby just pick one!\" So, Speaker B made two reservations at places she liked. Two days before the date, Speaker A tried to tell Speaker B he wanted to go to work, which upset her because he had months of notice and could easily request or switch the days off with his coworkers. He asked off for New Year's Day but not for their anniversary, which upset Speaker B even more, as he could have done both or just chosen one. He realized Speaker B was upset and said he would keep his word and that he understood her feelings. On the 28th at 10 PM, Speaker B got off work and called Speaker A to ask if she should pick up something to drink since they didn't work the next day. Speaker A said he was for sure going to work and was going back on his word yet again. He stated he didn't feel comfortable not going to work on their anniversary (Sunday) but would want to do something the next day, even though he was still scheduled. So, he would call out but just not that day? Attached is a picture of what Speaker B was met with. Speaker B is feeling frustrated because this is another promise Speaker A hasn't kept, along with other promises he leaves until the last second and then guilt trips her. Speaker B needs advice.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nSpeaker A promised to have anniversary plans but tried to go back on it, said never mind and that he understood Speaker B, and then actually did cancel. He said he didn't feel comfortable calling out of work on that day but would call out the next day and requested New Year's Day off when he could have easily requested their anniversary off instead or as well.

Speaker A responded dismissively, suggesting that Speaker B needed to grow up and implying they were being unreasonable.

Speaker A attempted to salvage the situation by asking for a conversation, but ultimately agreed to back off.", "c2_input": "Speaker B: I am extremely hurt and disappointed.

Her assistant, Lia (F28), found Speaker B\u2019s mom in her office, high out of her mind. Lia knew that Speaker B\u2019s mom had been five years sober, so she panicked and secretly carried Speaker B\u2019s mom out of the building into her car so coworkers wouldn\u2019t see her in that state.

He was delirious and anxiety-ridden. At 3 p.m., Maggie texted him, and they had an exchange. An hour later, she called him yelling about how he was out of line for adding Lia, that he was just going to end up sleeping with her, and that he should\u2019ve waited for Speaker B\u2019s mom to be able to call Lia herself in five days (she was on a psych hold).\n\nSpeaker B hasn\u2019t spoken to Maggie since then.

I didn\u2019t tell Maggie which hospital I\u2019m at, or I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve been here by now to continue this argument. \nI didn\u2019t want to make Lia wait for my mom to have access to her phone, especially after how much she did for my mom that day.\n\nWas I in the wrong? Is blocking her an overreaction? My girlfriend hasn\u2019t even seen the message exchange with Lia, this reaction from her is just from adding her. I am dreading going home and attempting to explain myself for being kind to my mom\u2019s employee who cares about her.\n(Names changed for anonymity)\n\n\nTL;DR- my mom\u2019s assistant literally assisted her during a relapse in her office. Mom\u2019s assistant drops off mom with me, asks me to update her on mom\u2019s condition. Mom and I go to hospital for detox. I add assistant on Facebook to give her my mom\u2019s hospital phone number. Girlfriend sees I added a woman on Facebook, gets mad even after knowing the very legitimate reason I had to add her."}

{"id": "1on4ee9", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B feels like they were manipulated by a man to become his side chick. Speaker B has very little dating experience, which has left them feeling confused about the situation. \n\nSpeaker B met this guy in their dancing class. At the end of the second class, he asked Speaker B if they would want to do some extra practice with him over the weekend. Speaker B agreed, and he messaged them the address later that night. They went to that studio to practice the following day. The studio is not easy to get to compared to others in the city, so it ended up just being the two of them dancing for three to four hours straight, which Speaker B did not know before going there. This weekend practice continued for another two to three weeks. He put effort into teaching Speaker B new movements, complimented their progress, and they started talking about other aspects of their lives. Speaker B could feel that he was making advances toward them. He offered to take Speaker B on a motorcycle ride when he found out they had never been on one before. Meanwhile, they kept seeing each other in the usual dancing class, and he consistently tried to dance with Speaker B for both the opening and closing dances, purposely walking toward them so they would be right next to him when those dances started. Speaker B thought, \u201cI can spend a bit more time with him to see how things go.\u201d It was always good to practice with someone who danced well, and he seemed to be a nice person.\n\nOne day after classes, he drove to Speaker B's place (he had dropped them off after the motorcycle ride, so he knew their address) and called them to come down because he needed to tell them something. He said he wanted to be fully honest and transparent with Speaker B because their dancing together could turn into \u201csomething else.\u201d He explained that he was in a \u201ccontract\u201d with a lady. They came from the same country and had known each other since childhood. When they moved to the area, they felt vulnerable and got together. The lady had told him at the very beginning that she had no intention of making the relationship long-term because she ultimately wanted to move to Spain, while he wanted to stay. However, he felt responsible for taking care of her and helping her get a partner visa with him. Their \u201ccontract\u201d was supposed to end on September 25, but she decided to stay until January 26, extending the \u201ccontract.\u201d They were separating because she was ultimately leaving, and January 26 would be a new start for him. After that conversation, Speaker B was under the impression that their relationship was now just for appearances for the sake of the lady\u2019s visa and that there was little to no emotional substance left. Speaker B did not think this arrangement was right in many ways, but ultimately, whatever arrangement they had was not of Speaker B's concern. Speaker B thought they would just keep him at arm's length as someone to practice dancing with and did not think too much of it.\n\nThe next time they practiced together, they finished very late, so they went out of the studio to get some dinner. He again brought up the \u201ccontract\u201d and said that the lady recognized it was unfair to him, so she allowed him space to go out dancing and meet other people. While they were eating, that lady actually called him, and he told her straight away that he was having dinner with Speaker B. After the call, he reiterated that they were going separate ways and everything would end in January, no matter what happened with that lady. Speaker B believed him because they could not think of why someone would be okay with their partner spending an extended amount of time dancing and hanging out with someone else. By that time, they had been practicing just the two of them for about a month. Speaker B was still feeling a bit unsure about the whole situation but did not want to appear judgmental of their arrangement. Speaker B was also on a visa and understood that sometimes it was a difficult situation to be in. They thought they would just see how things went because, at that time, Speaker B did not think he had bad intentions, so they accepted his advances, which now made Speaker B want to punch themselves.\n\nSpeaker B and the man started messaging each other every two to three days. He called Speaker B once or twice, and they talked about other hobbies, work, and family, making the conversations personal and sometimes a bit flirty. However, because of his \u201ccontract\u201d with the lady, Speaker B never made up their mind regarding him.\n\nOne day, he messaged Speaker B saying he deleted some of their text messages on his phone. The lady found out and was not happy about it, so they broke up. Speaker B was very confused because they had always been under the impression that it was no longer an actual relationship and that they had already broken up. Speaker B instantly felt that he was lying and got a bit angry, replying, \u201cPlease don\u2019t involve me in your problems, and I will not be going to that studio again.\u201d He said he understood and that it was his fault. After thinking about it for a while, Speaker B considered that it could genuinely be a really messed-up situation and that it was never fun to break up with someone. They realized the tone of their message might have been a bit harsh for what he was going through. So when he messaged Speaker B saying he wouldn\u2019t make it to class on time, Speaker B replied, \u201cI hope you are doing okay.\u201d He basically said he was trying to move on and then asked Speaker B to help him with his translation exam. This was not coming out of nowhere, as he had mentioned he had an exam the following week and Speaker B had done a similar exam before. Speaker B knew that could be an excuse he made up to see them, but they wanted to know what exactly happened, so they agreed to meet him.\n\nThey worked on his exam material and then went out to get some food afterward. Speaker B asked him what exactly happened. He repeated the same thing. Speaker B said, \u201cI only let you make advances because I thought your relationship was just for appearances and for the lady\u2019s visa, and she was allowing you to meet other people.\u201d He then said that the lady\u2019s visa was not actually a partner visa with him. He followed up by saying maybe he didn\u2019t say it clearly, but it was his offer to get her a partner visa so she wouldn\u2019t have to study and work at the same time, but the lady refused. Speaker B asked, \u201cBut you said she allows you to meet other people; was the relationship real or not?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, there are feelings left, and she saw the rest of the message and thought we had a physical relationship. Well, maybe in January we feel like it, it might happen. But yeah, she wasn\u2019t happy, and she broke up with me. Well, there is nothing else then because we actually broke up. Though it was supposed to be January, now there is nothing left. And I need to move on.\u201d Speaker B felt very confused, wondering when they had given him the idea that they might get physical. When they parted, he even tried to kiss Speaker B, but they resisted, saying, \u201cThis is going too quickly, and I am confused. We are not at the stage where I feel okay with you kissing me.\u201d He said he understood, said goodbye, and left. Speaker B thought that was it; they stopped messaging for the whole week.\n\nHowever, last Friday in class (Halloween), he showed up early in costume (he knew Speaker B was always early because they took public transport and needed to be super early or they would be super late) and bought Speaker B a matching headpiece to wear. Speaker B did not think much of it, as it was just Halloween stuff. They were not that into dressing up as characters, but they wore it and danced the opening. While they were dancing, other people started to arrive and watched them dance. When the class started and they swapped dance partners, one girl asked him if he and Speaker B were sticking together and not changing partners (usually they rotate partners unless a couple comes together to class and says they want to stick together). Speaker B felt weird and was unsure if he had done the costume and dancing thing on purpose to let others see it. However, it would look rude if they refused to dance with him, so Speaker B did not say or do anything. Again, he grabbed Speaker B for the closing dance and walked them to the bus stop. Speaker B asked what the costume was about, and he just said it was Halloween. Speaker B thought they were just overthinking things. The next day, when they went to the dance school for practice (not the one that is hard to get to, but the one with a lot of other people), he seemed a bit distant. Speaker B thought if he wanted to distance himself, they would just let him. Plus, he was busy taking videos for the teachers for a demonstration, so Speaker B did not think much of it. He again followed Speaker B to the bus stop after practice finished, but another person was going to the same bus stop. Speaker B could tell he wanted to talk, but because of the other person, he couldn\u2019t. Speaker B did not think much of it, believing that if it was important, he could text them.\n\nThe next day, Speaker B was watching some videos about the dance movement they tried during practice and sent them to him. He then replied with a huge paragraph saying he was now back with that lady and that they could still dance together. He also mentioned that the lady actually knew Speaker B and thought they would be a good dancer. Speaker B felt beyond confused and suspected he was lying about something. It seemed like he was trying to", "c1_input": "Speaker A informed Speaker B about a breakup caused by their previous flirtation and expressed regret for their actions.

I do apologise if this makes you feel uncomfortable.\nSpeaker B: Please do not involve me in your issue with her, that is not my business.

I only let it slide because you explained it in a way that makes me think that you two are still together just for the sake of helping her with her visa, and you two have both mentally moved on, and she allows you space to meet other ppl.\nSpeaker B: So it seems sth is very wrong here. I don't want to be involved in any of this. but thanks for letting me know\nSpeaker A: Once again I'm sorry, you did nothing wrong, it was me.

However, as you know I did wrong lying and hiding things from the lady and that led to the premature and painful break up of our relationship. Now I was granted another chance and I am commited to do things properly to recover her trust. You didn't understand the reason we where still together and the truth is there have always been emotions and feelings involved. Honestly I have been too sad because it wasn't mean to end like this. it was meant to be a special and memorable love until the end because that is how always love should be.\nIn this order,  I need to put limits myself and you will notice that the frequency of the messages will be reduced. We can still be friends because I appreciate and overall I admire you a lot. It's just I realized I need to prioritize my time and energy to the person I love. I have told the lady about you and indespite of the situation she has a good feeling about you and she is happy to imagine the far you could go in your tango journey, because of your discipline.

So the having dinner after practice/class, talking at the bus stop, helping you with your exam ect. will not happen again.

I just really don't want to be involved in other couple's live by becoming a problem.\nSpeaker A: Thank you so much for understanding, also for expressing yourself in a comprehensive way, it is important for me.

This is throw away account. As the title says, I feel like I got manipulated by a man to become his side chick. I have very little dating experience so I am super confused and I need to know if I am overeating/being stupid/going crazy. Sorry there is quite a bit of rambling. \nSo I met this guy in my dancing class. At the end of the second class, he asked me if I would want to do some extra practice with him over the weekend, I said yes why not, he messaged me the address later that night and we went to that studio to practice the day after. The studio is not that easy to get to compared to other ones in my city, so it ended up just two of us dancing for 3, 4 hrs straight (i didn\u2019t know this before i actually went there) . And this weekend practice thing kept going for another 2, 3 weeks. He put some effort to teach me new movement, complimenting my progress and we started talking about other things in our lives. I could feel that he started making advance towards me. He offered to take me on a motorcycle ride when he found out I had never been on one before. Meanwhile we kept seeing each other in the usual dancing class and he started to consistently try to dance with me for both the opening and closing dance (he purposely walks towards me so I would be right next to him when the opening and closing dance start).  My mind was like  \u201cI can spend a bit more time with him to see how things go\u201d . It is always good to practice with someone who dances well and he seemed to be a nice person. \nOne day after classes (I am only attending the lvl1 class as I just started this style while he stays for lvl 2 and 3), he drove to my place (he dropped me off that time we went on the motorcycle ride so he knows where my address bruhhh) and called me to come down coz he needed to tell me sth. He said he wanted to be fully honest and transparent with me, coz we dancing together could turn into \u201csth else\u201d. He said he is in a \u201ccontract\u201d with a lady. They came from the same country and they know each other since childhood. When they moved here they felt venerable and just got together.  The lady told him at the very beginning that she had no intention to make this relationship a long term one coz she ultimately wants to move to Spain while the guy wants to stay. But he feels that he is responsible for taking care of her and let her get on a partner visa with him. Their \u201ccontract\u201d was supposed to end in Sep 25, but she decided to stay till Jan 26, so the \u201ccontract\u201d extended. They are separating coz ultimately she is leaving, and Jan 26 would be a new start for him so on so forth. After that conversation, I was under the impression that, their relationship is now just for appearance for the sake of the lady\u2019s visa and there is little to none emotional substance left. I don\u2019t think this arrangement is right in a lot of ways. But ultimately whatever arrangement they have is not of my concern. I thought I would just keep him at arms length as someone I practice dancing with and didn\u2019t really think too much of it. \nThe next time we practice together, we finished till very late, so we went out of the studio to get some dinner. He again cycled back to the \u201ccontract\u201d he talked about and said that the lady recognised that it is unfair for him, so she allows him space to go out dancing and meet other ppl. And while we were eating , that lady in question actually called him and he told her straight away that he was having dinner with me. After the call he said again they are going separate ways and everything ends in January no matter what happens woth that lady. I believed in what he said coz couldn\u2019t think of why someone would be OK with their partner spending extended amount of time dancing and hanging out with someone else (by that time we have been practicing just two of us for about a month). I was still feeling a bit unsure about the whole thing, but I don\u2019t want to appear to be judgemental of their situation. I was on visa as well and I understand that sometimes it is a difficult situation to be in. I thought I would just see how things go, coz still at that time I didn\u2019t think he had bad intention, so I accepted his advances towards me, which now MAKES ME WANT TO PUNCH MYSELF! \nSo we started messaging each other maybe every 2, 3 days. He called me once or twice. We talked about other hobbies, work and family stuff, so it was getting personal and sometimes it got a bit flirty. But because his \u201ccontract\u201d with the lady, I never made up my mind regarding him. \nOne day, he messaged me saying he deleted some of our text messages on his phone. They lady found out and was not happy about that so they .... broke up?! I was so very confused, coz all the time I was under the impression that it is no longer an actual relationship and they have in reality already broken up. I instantly felt that he was lying to me, I got a bit angry and replied saying \u201cplz don\u2019t involve me in your guys\u2019 problem and I will not be going to that studio again\u201d. He said he understood and this is his fault. After thinking about it for a while, I thought it could be genuinely a really messed up situation and it is never fun to break up with someone, and the tone of my message might be a bit harsh for what he was going through (OMG I AM SUCH A PPL PLEASER!), so when he messaged me saying he wouldn\u2019t make it to class on time, I messaged back saying \u201cI hope you are doing ok\u201d. He basically said he is trying to move on and then asked me to help him with his translation exam. This was not coming out of nowhere as he did mention he had an exam the following week and I had done similar exam before. I knew that could be an excuse he made up to see me, but I wanted to know what exactly happened(maybe not the smartest idea), so I agreed to me meet him. \nWe worked on his exam material then we went out to get some food after. So I asked him what exactly happened. He repeated the same thing. I said, I only let you make advances because I thought your relationship is just for appearance and for the lady\u2019s visa and she is allowing you to meet other ppl. He then said, the lady\u2019s visa is not actually a parent visa with him??????? He followed up saying maybe he didn\u2019t say it clearly, but it was him offer to get her a partner visa so she doesn\u2019t have to study and work at the same time but the lady refused. \u201cBut you said she allows you to meet other ppl, was the relationship or not?\u201d He said \u201cwell there is feeling left and she saw the rest of the message and thought we have a physical relationship, well maybe in January we feel like it, it might happen. But yeah she wasn\u2019t happy and she broke up with me. Well, there is nothing else then coz we actually broke up. Though it was supposed to be January, but now there is nothing left. And I need to move on.\u201d I felt so very confused, like since when did I give him the idea that we might get physical?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!??!?! So I made it very clear when we parted,  he even tried to kiss me but I resisted saying \u201cthis is going too quickly and I am confused. We are not at the stage where I feel ok with you kissing me\u201d. He said he understood and he said bye and left. I thought that's it, we stopped messaging for the whole week. \nBut last Friday in class (Halloween) he showed up early in costume (he knows i am always early coz i take public transport and i am need to be super early or i would be super late), and bought me a matching headpiece to wear. I didn\u2019t think much of it, like it is just Halloween stuff, I am not that into dressing up as a character but it could be just me. So I just wore it and we danced the opening. While we were dancing other ppl started to arrive and were watching us dancing. When the class started and we swapped dance partner, one girl asked him if he and I are sticking together and not changing partner (usually we rotate partners unless a couple come together to class and say that they want to stick together). I felt weird, now i wasn\u2019t so sure if he did that custom and dancing thing on purpose to let other ppl see it. But it would look rude if i refuse to dance with him so I didn\u2019t say or do anything. Again he grabbed me for the closing dance and walked me to the bus stop. I said what is the costume about. He just said it is Halloween. I thought I was just thinking too much. The next day when we went to the dance school for practice (not the one that is hard to get to, but the one of the dancing school where there are a lot of other ppl), he seemed a bit distant. I thought if he wanted to distant I would just let him. Plus he was busy taking videos for the teachers for a demonstration. I didn\u2019t think much of it. But he again followed me to the bust stop after the practice finished but another person was going to the same bus stop , I could tell he wanted to talk to me but coz of the other person was there he couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t think much of it, if it is important he could text me.\nThen the next day, I was watching some videos about the dance movement we tried during the practice and I sent it to him. He them replied with a HUGE paragraph saying he is now back with that lady?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!? And said we can still dance together ?!??!?!?!??! And that lady actually knows me??!?!??!!? And think I would be good dancer?!?!??!?!?!?!\nI am just beyond confused now. I feel like he is lying about sth. And he is trying to manipulate me to be his side piece. But again, if he just wanted to have a side piece, there is no need for him to tell me about the lady. Who breaks up and get back together within just a week????? I did a bit of digging online, I can see there is an account with the name of that said lady on FB, but it is private so I didn\u2019t get much info out of it. I replied to him, set some boundaries, he agreed. It looks like this saga is ending for real. But I am not sure if he is going to pull some other stuns if we see each other again in class. I am now contemplating that I should just stop going to that dance school. But idk if I am overeating. It could be he is just genuinely confused about his feeling in a complicated situation and that is the end of it and there would be nothing else between us. \nThis is getting too long, but guys! Plz tell me if I am overeating! Am I just being so very stupid??? Am i missing sth??? Thanks for reading! \n\n"}

{"id": "1jfliv5", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B heard from Speaker A that she was venting about how Speaker B was \"such a child and raised horribly and doesn\u2019t care about anyone but herself and a fucking bitch.\" Speaker B noted that Speaker A was the one who lost custody and her wife for cheating with the neighbor, using drugs, opioids, and drinking while Speaker B and her sister were around two years old. Additionally, Speaker B mentioned that Speaker A had been kicked out of rehab for being sexually inappropriate with people there, despite having a wife and two kids at home. The list of issues seemed endless, and Speaker B felt compelled to write about it.\n\nSpeaker B expressed her feelings in a message:\n\n\u201cSpeaker B cannot help Speaker A and has said this multiple times. Speaker B is trying to be kind and look at things from Speaker A's perspective but has communicated everything that Speaker A needs to know. Speaker B is busy and cannot assist at this time, but believes Speaker A is capable and a strong woman and mother. Speaker B suggested that Speaker A take an Uber to AutoZone, emphasizing that she is not choosing someone else over Speaker A. Speaker B wants Speaker A to trust in her ability to take care of herself and has already acknowledged the need to fix her headlight. Speaker B understands that Speaker A is her mother, and nothing will change that. Speaker B loves Speaker A and sees her struggles and pain, but needs to take a step back. Speaker B cannot continue the current cycle as she is hurting and healing. Speaker B needs to prioritize her own well-being and is tired of feeling obligated to fix things for Speaker A simply because she is her mother. Speaker B feels bound to Speaker A by blood but believes their relationship has been harmed due to past issues not being properly addressed and a lack of accountability. Speaker B and her partner constantly worry about Speaker A. Speaker B recalls staying up at night, terrified that Speaker A might not be okay, feeling a lack of consistent evidence to the contrary. Speaker B's life has been completely shifted because of Speaker A's unwillingness to address her mental illness in a constructive way that does not involve her children. Speaker B is uncertain if Speaker A is ready to accept that she has hurt not only herself but also her entire family.\n\nSpeaker B clarified that her intention is not to shame Speaker A or make her feel unworthy of love. She is sharing this with the hope of healing and starting a new cycle with Speaker A, grounded in love, honesty, and kindness.\n\nSpeaker B wants a relationship with Speaker A and desires her to be her mother, but cannot continue in the current manner.\n\nSpeaker A had expressed, \u201cI guess I\u2019m a bad mother and you don\u2019t love me,\u201d which Speaker B internalized for years. Since childhood, Speaker B felt the need to \u201csave\u201d Speaker A.\n\nSpeaker B stated the facts: Speaker A abused her, her partner, and her ex-wife, and continues to abuse herself and her authority as Speaker B's mother. Speaker A uses her role as a mother as an excuse for Speaker B to help her with matters that do not involve her. Speaker A got herself into this mess and needs to find a way out. Speaker B cannot assist her. Speaker A has caused Speaker B pain, and she will have to relearn how to navigate life due to the consequences of Speaker A's actions. Speaker A held Speaker B's head underwater as a child while she and her sister were fighting, believing it was the right thing to do. Speaker B expressed disbelief at this behavior, stating that Speaker A choked and hit her and her sister. Speaker B believes Speaker A has no idea of the extent of the harm she has caused to their family due to her defensiveness and inability to confront the truth of the situation. Speaker B emphasized that Speaker A is her mother, not her equal, and she feels compelled to remind her of this. Speaker B does not owe Speaker A anything, especially since she has not been there for her when needed. While Speaker A was present for birthday parties and hospital visits, Speaker B feels she was also abused, both mentally and physically. Speaker B acknowledges that Speaker A is sick but still loves her. She believes Speaker A is a significant barrier in her life and has a right to be angry about it. Speaker B is furious and loves Speaker A, but her anger is profound. Speaker A has said things that Speaker B will never forget, which she has internalized and repressed. Speaker A is the main reason for Speaker B's addiction and pain, which goes deeper than the physical and current events. It relates to Speaker A's life and experiences. Speaker B believes Speaker A is in the process of creating generational trauma. While Speaker B understands that Speaker A's upbringing was likely traumatic and difficult, she believes Speaker A thinks she has \u201cgraduated therapy\u201d or does not need it. Speaker B asserts that Speaker A needs help, not only as her mother but as a human being. Speaker B is expressing this because no one else will. Speaker A is sick and needs assistance. Speaker B believes Speaker A has the resources\u2014money, friends, and family\u2014but she cannot help her. If Speaker A does not seek help immediately, clean up her life, and get rid of her dog, Speaker B will pursue a restraining order against her. Speaker B knows Speaker A may think she is overreacting or that someone else is influencing her thoughts, but she has seen the facts and knows everything she needs to know about the situation. Speaker B has not been sane in years and has tried for nearly 21 years to help Speaker A. She moved in with her for a year, cleaned up her mess, and ended up in rehab and the psych ward, relapsing in the process. Despite this, Speaker A continues to ask for help. Speaker B appreciates Speaker A's attempts to mend their relationship with gifts, acknowledging that the comic-con tickets were thoughtful and that she enjoyed the experience. Speaker B recognizes Speaker A's love for her, but she also loves Speaker A in ways she may not fully understand. Speaker B urges Speaker A to seek help, stating that she cannot assist her. She expresses her love and emphasizes that if Speaker A contacts her partner to change her mind, it will only make the decision to file a restraining order easier. Speaker B acknowledges the difficulty of her decision, stating that it is the hardest thing she has ever done. She is currently crying and has experienced multiple panic attacks over the need for Speaker A to help herself and change for the better so that Speaker B can heal. If Speaker A truly loves and cares for Speaker B, she will respect her decision and seek help from a higher power or someone else, or else not have a relationship with Speaker B. Speaker B recommends that Speaker A join an AA group and work through the 12 steps, believing that Speaker A needs it. Speaker B feels that Speaker A is a \u201cdry drunk\u201d who has not genuinely recovered but has merely repressed and denied her issues for years. Speaker B encourages Speaker A to find a higher power other than herself and make amends. If Speaker B is working the steps at 20 years old, Speaker A can do the same if she wants the relationship she believes she deserves with Speaker B. Speaker B suggests that Speaker A find a sponsor, which is free, and start her healing journey for herself and her relationships. Ultimately, it is up to Speaker A to make this decision, and Speaker B urges her to choose wisely. She expresses her love and encourages Speaker A to take care of herself.\n\nSpeaker B states that if Speaker A tries to show up at her house, she will call the police. If Speaker A goes through her partner to contact her, Speaker B will seek a restraining order. If Speaker A attempts to use anyone or anything to see her, Speaker B will pursue a restraining order. At this moment, Speaker B cannot see Speaker A and does not feel safe with her mentally. She is triggered beyond repair and needs time to heal. Speaker B demands that Speaker A allow her the space she needs and refrain from hurting anyone that Speaker B loves, as Speaker A has done enough. Speaker B believes that healing cannot come from gifts and love; it requires facing issues head-on, apologizing, taking accountability, and actively trying to change. All Speaker B asks is for Speaker A to try. Speaker B has made efforts, including asking Speaker A to go to therapy, but Speaker A declined, leading Speaker B to feel done for now. She expresses her love and urges Speaker A to take care of herself.\n\nSpeaker B has personally contacted someone at Pro Hazard to assist Speaker A. His name is ******, and he needs Speaker A's permission to clean up her space. \n\nSpeaker A responded:\n\nShe believed she had taken full responsibility for her actions repeatedly. Speaker A stated that she cannot take responsibility for what she has not done and expressed concern that the more time Speaker B spends listening to others, the more injured she becomes with anger toward Speaker A.\n\nSpeaker A acknowledged that Speaker B was strong as a child and that when she would attack someone, Speaker A had to pull her off the best way she could. Speaker A described the situation as rough but not abusive, attributing Speaker B's behavior to rage caused by her misophonia. Speaker A claimed her goal was to seclude Speaker B to prevent injury to anyone. She mentioned that there are still holes in the door from Speaker B's rage and explained that it was a neurological disorder. Speaker A described how Speaker B would charge at her, hitting her hard, while Speaker A resisted. She insisted that it was not abuse from either of them but rather a physical and emotional response. Speaker A apologized if Speaker B recalls any hitting on her part during those times.\n\nSpeaker A acknowledged that Speaker B was traumatized by their forced separation when she was eight years old, stating", "c1_input": "Speaker A asked Speaker B for help after their car battery died, but Speaker B was unable to assist due to a tight schedule and lack of transportation. Despite Speaker A's insistence and attempts to negotiate a time for help, Speaker B maintained that they could not rearrange their plans.

Because I feel like I haven\u2019t had consistent evidence telling me otherwise. My life has been completely shifted because of the fact that you are unwilling to address your mental illness in a way that will actually help you and in a way that doesn\u2019t involve your kids. I don\u2019t know if you are ready to accept the fact that you have not only hurt yourself, but hurt your entire family around you.\n\n(this is not to make you feel shame. This is not to make you feel like you are not worthy of love. I am only telling you this with the intention to heal and start a new cycle with you. With love, honesty, and kindness.)\n\nI want a relationship with you. I want you to be my mother. But I cannot continue like this.\n\nIn your words \u201cI guess I\u2019m a bad mother and you don\u2019t love me.\u201d I internalized that for years and ever since I was small I always felt like I had to \u201cSave you.\u201d\n\nThe fact is you abused me, ****** and your ex-wife, ******. And continually abuse yourself and your authority as my mother. You\u2019re using being my mom as an excuse for me to help you figure out things that do not involve me. You got yourself into this mess, you can get yourself out. I can\u2019t help you. You have hurt me, and in a way, I will have to relearn how to do things all over again with the amount of shit I\u2019ve had to deal with from your actions. You held my head under water as a child while ****** and I were fighting? And I know you thought that was probably the right thing to do? But what the fuck. You choked me, you hit me. You hit ******, you choked her. You hit and choked ******. You have no idea about the extent of what you\u2019ve done to this family because you are so defensive that you cannot look at the truth of the situation. You are my mother, not my equal, and I cannot believe I have to tell you this. I do not owe you anything, especially since you haven\u2019t been there for me when I needed you. Yes, you were there for my birthday parties, when I was in the hospital, you love me, you birthed me, and you took care of me, but you abused me. Mentally and physically. You are sick. But regardless, I still love you. I\u2019m telling you this because you are my biggest block in this life. I have a right to be angry. And I am furious. I love you. But I\u2019m angry. You have told me things that I will never forget. That I have internalized, repressed, and eventually started using to forget about. You are my main reason for my addiction. You are my main reason for my pain. This is deeper than physical and what has just happened to me. This is about what has happened to you and your life. You are currently in the process of creating generational trauma. And I know growing up for you was probably very traumatic and hard, and I know you think you\u2019ve \u201cgraduated therapy\u201d or don\u2019t need it. You need help ******, not only as my mother, but as a human being. I am telling you this because no one else will. You are sick, you need help. You have money, you have friends, you have family, and I cannot help you. If you don\u2019t get help immediately and get rid of that dog, send her to a better home and if you don\u2019t clean your shit up, like your house and your life, I will go to court and get a restraining order on you. And I know you think I\u2019m crazy or manic or that this is someone else\u2019s doing or somebody else telling me about you and spreading lies. I have seen the facts. I\u2019ve seen it for myself. I know everything I need to know about the situation. And quite frankly, I haven\u2019t been sane in years. I have tried for 20 years, almost 21 years, to help you. I moved in with you for a year. I cleaned up your mess by myself. I ended up in rehab and the psych ward and relapsed. And you continue to ask for my help. I appreciate you trying to mend our relationship with gifts, and those comicon tickets were really sweet and I had a great time. I know you love me and I know you love me. I love you in ways you don\u2019t even know and this is why I\u2019m telling you. Please get help, I cannot help you. I love you, mommy. And if you contact ****** about this and try and change my mind, that will only make my decision of filing a restraining order much easier. I know you think this is probably easy for me, but this is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019m currently crying and I\u2019ve had multiple panic attacks about the fact that I have to let you help yourself and change for the better, so I can heal. If you truly, in your heart of hearts, love me and care for me, like you say you do, you will respect my decision, and seek either a higher power or someone else to help you or not have a relationship with me. I highly recommend an AA group and working your 12 steps. You might not think you need it, but I believe you do. I believe you are a \u201cdry drunk,\u201d and you haven\u2019t actually recovered. You have just repressed and denied for years. I recommend you find a higher power other than yourself and make amends. If I am working the steps as a 20-year-old, you can work the steps if you want the relationship you feel like you deserve with me. I recommend getting a sponsor (It\u2019s free) and I recommend you start your healing journey not only for yourself, but for your relationships. It is honestly up to you and what you want. This is your decision, choose wisely. I love you, please take care of yourself.\n\nIf you try to show up to my house in this moment in time, I will call the police. If you go through ****** to contact me, I will get a restraining order. If you\u2019re trying to use anyone or anything to see me, I will get a restraining order. Right now I cannot see you. I do not feel safe with you mentally. I am triggered beyond repair and need time to heal. And since you\u2019re in the mood for demanding, I will demand this: you allow me the space, and you will not hurt anybody that I love because you have done enough. You cannot heal things with gifts and love, you have to face your shit head-on, apologize, take accountability, and actively try and change. All I\u2019m asking is for you to try. And trust me, I have tried. I asked you to go to therapy, and you said no, so I\u2019m done for now. I love you, take care of yourself.*\nI\u2019ve personally contacted someone at Pro Hazard to help you out. His name is ******. And he needs your permission to be able to clean your space up.\nThis is his number: ****** \u201c\n\n\nMy moms response\u2026.\n\n\u201cI thought I have taken full responsibility for everything I have done. Over and over again and again. I cannot take responsibility for what I have not done. And the more time you spend listening to ***** the more injured you become with your anger toward me.\n\nBut for my responsibility for my actions: You were so strong as a child and when you would attack *****, I HAD to pull you off of her the best way I could. It was rough, but it was not abuse my love. It was violent, it was you being violent because of the rage caused by your misophonia. You couldn\u2019t help it, and my goal was to get you secluded so you wouldn\u2019t injure us. There are still holes in the door from your rage. It\u2019s a neurological disorder. You would charge at me like a bull, hitting me as hard as you could, trying to push me over. I resisted. It was very physical. But it was not abuse. From me or you. It was emotional and neurological from you. I had to be strong and had to handle you firmly but with care. If you recall any hitting on my part during these times I\u2019m so sorry *****. I don\u2019t remember it that way.\n\nSomething to heal from:\nI do know you were traumatized by our forced separation when you were 8 years old. I was too. That needs to be recognized and honored as that was very traumatizing and painful. I do believe that is where a lot of your sadness, pain, and anger towards me stems from, and blaming me for the separation has always been the story. However, my trauma and your trauma stem from *****'s weaponization of therapists and the court to get that outcome she paid for. It damaged all of us. She has to continue her version of the story in order to live with herself and the damage she did to us.\n\nApology:\nIf I have not apologized for any wrongdoing that I actually did to you from your own memory, then please allow me that privilege. What I do know is that ***** continues to tell you horrible untrue things about me that are causing you to have negative thoughts, feelings, and reactions. I know this because I have dealt with this for years. All these untruths are meant to hurt me, but they are hurting you honey. Like using the words \u201ctried to drown you.\u201d Give me a break. I dunked you at the popcorn pool all the time while teaching you to swim at this age. All I did was let the water hit your face and you stopped trying to bite *****. Do you see how stories meant to harm me actually harm you? She wasn\u2019t even there. I told her over the phone. It was very uneventful. The main point was you stopped trying to bite ***** because you held your breath for a brief second.\n\nTime away and pain relief:\nI\u2019d gladly walk away from you if that would ease your pain and heal you but I don\u2019t think it would because you continue to engage in conversations with ***** that are aimed at alienating you and me (it\u2019s working by the way) causing you more pain. Rinse and repeat!\n\nReality orientation:\nBut know this my love.\nI\u2019m so sorry for the times I hurt you emotionally or physically. As for my mental illness, it is a trauma response (frozen) caused by the narcissistic and borderline abuse I endured from ***** during our divorce and custody battle. And work trauma combined. Know that you are not responsible for ANYTHING having to do with taking care of me, nothing. You are also NOT responsible to have to listen to *****'s version of history because she has documented mental illnesses that require her mind to distort reality to preserve her ego. So, stop listening to that crap, it will continue to injure you and distort your reality and memories. You can have a copy of a lengthy parenting evaluation that is a legal representation of our home life where ***** DENIES any and ALL physical violence in our home. Except admitting to hitting me a few times and kicking me when I was pregnant. Stop listening to her distortions, they are not reality-based. Her stories are meant to make you not feel safe, trust, or want to have anything to do with me. Because that is how SHE feels.\n\nTaking care of myself:\nI know you are worried about me.\nYou \u201chad\u201d every right to worry and be scared and angry. I almost died ***** and then my body betrayed me while I was healing and I became chronically ill and couldn\u2019t walk or do anything. You felt helpless, and angry, and resentful. I couldn\u2019t reassure you because I was fighting to reassure me. But I survived, I fought my way back and I\u2019m so lucky. I\u2019m walking, working, and beginning to thrive.\nI\u2019m still stuck in the frozen part of fight or flight mode, but I am recognizing what is actually going on with me and that\u2019s the first step to wellness. Thank you for the cleaner contact.\n\nAs for the ride to *****:\nI apologize for triggering you with being adamant you give me a ride. It didn\u2019t weigh as much for me as it did you, and I had a completely different perspective because I didn\u2019t know you felt the way you did.\n\nYou take all the time away from me that you need. Know that I love and miss you.\u201d\n\n\nP.S. with me \u201cBreaking down the door and leaving holes in it.\u201d Is literally because she wouldn\u2019t let me leave the house after hitting me!! And locked me in the fu*king bedroom!! I was like 10 or 11 like she was wayyyy over 200 pounds\ud83d\ude2d what is a 5\u20194-5\u20193 chubby lil 10 year old gonna do to this women? Who kind you raised me on wrestling grew up on a farm???!! And ALWAYS made sure for me to feel her muscles! Like girl the denial is a river in Egypt\u2026\n"}

I applied with this company Wednesday and they got back to me on Friday at 5:19PM. Which in my case is past any work hours and into the weekend where I log off completely. (As do many other companies do as well.) You can see I promptly responded on Monday at 7:00AM, and heard nothing. I decided to wait 2 days and reach out again and ask if they are still considering me for the role. To where he proceeded to insult me about being lazy for not\u2026 \u201cshowing up\u201d to an interview. Which mind you they have not once reached out to me via call/text/message. I have a screenshot of my email folder as the last slide as proof. I haven\u2019t heard a single thing from them since I applied. So I decided to respond with a (yes I know) backhanded response. Letting them know that no one has contacted me for an interview. And I\u2019m sure you all can see how it escalated from there. So I ask AIO for thinking that these guys were completely out of line and unprofessional? They called me names and insulted me, which I know I did back but. I\u2019m a bit of a hot head my self lol. Not trying to justify what I did but then he also attempted to call my current employer and say god knows what. Thankfully I work for a place that values my privacy and gave them no mention of my name. Which is where he thinks I \u201clied\u201d on my application. Is there anything I can do here? I couldn\u2019t find them on the BBB or anything as such. \nOne way to ruin my Friday lol. \nLet me know what you all think. "}

{"id": "1marlaf", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B made a post a few days ago about a guy who matched with them on Hinge and then became extremely unsettling after they started talking. He was upset that Speaker B was a tattoo artist, even though Speaker B's entire Hinge profile included several mentions of being an artist.\n\nAfter Speaker B made the post, the guy texted them several times. Speaker B ignored his texts, so he went and found Speaker B's Facebook. Speaker B was unsure how he managed to do this, as their Facebook settings were configured to prevent anyone from finding them in the search bar, and all of Speaker B's friends were set to private. After he texted Speaker B on Facebook, Speaker B blocked his number, Messenger, and Facebook.\n\nOn that day, Speaker B received texts from him on Instagram, threatening to show up at Speaker B's work. Speaker B had never listed their tattoo studio anywhere and had never posted which studio they worked at online, which caused them to feel scared. Speaker B truly did not know how he figured it out, as even their tattoo page did not have that information listed. He did not text Speaker B's tattoo Instagram; instead, he contacted Speaker B's main Instagram profile.\n\nSpeaker B called their boss to ask why the receptionist had given out information about when Speaker B would be at work. Apparently, the guy pretended to be Speaker B's cousin, somehow knowing the cousin's name (someone Speaker B's boss had tattooed before), and acted like him, claiming he wanted to know what time Speaker B would be in the next day for a flash tattoo. The receptionist informed Speaker B's boss that \"Speaker B's cousin _____ wants to know when Speaker B will be here tomorrow for a small tattoo,\" so Speaker B's boss provided that information.\n\nSpeaker B told their boss everything that had happened and decided not to go in the next day for safety reasons.

I ignored his texts, so he went and FOUND my Facebook. I deadass don\u2019t know how he did because I have my Facebook settings to where you can\u2019t even find me in the search bar thingy and have all my friends private. After he texted me on Facebook, I blocked his number, messenger, and Facebook.\n\nWell today I get texts from him on INSTAGRAM telling me he\u2019s gonna show up to my work!!! I didn\u2019t have my tattoo studio listed anywhere and have never posted which studio I work at online. This scared me. I truly do not know how he figured it out, because even my tattoo page has none of it listed! (He didn\u2019t text my tattoo instagram, he texted my main instagram profile).\n\nI called my boss after this and asked why he let the receptionist give out when I was at work, apparently this dude pretended to be my COUSIN???? He somehow knew my cousins name (someone my boss has tattooed before), and acted like him and said he wanted to know what time I was in tomorrow so I could do a flash tattoo on him. The receptionist just told my boss like \u201chey, op\u2019s cousin _____ wants to know when op will be here tomorrow for a small tattoo\u201d, so my boss told him.\n\nI told my boss everything that happened and I\u2019m not going in tomorrow just to be safe. My boss said he\u2019s gonna be on the lookout, but since I won\u2019t be there, everything should be fine. Maybe I\u2019m being dramatic by not showing up, I don\u2019t actually think he\u2019d like kill me or something, but you never know. Anyways, here\u2019s an update for y\u2019all.

{"id": "1ln5m66", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B (26F) has been best friends with Speaker A (32F) for 12 years. They met online through writing forums and have spent over the last decade writing together. They had dreams of publishing together and engaged in extensive, Game of Thrones-level world-building, plots, and characters. Speaker B considered Speaker A a sister, and given that Speaker B barely talks to their birth family, Speaker A was the most important person in Speaker B's life until Speaker B met their wife four years ago. Speaker B even moved cross-country from the Midwest to the East Coast when they were 19 to live with Speaker A, although they had to move back to the Midwest three years ago due to financial reasons.\n\nSpeaker B was the maid of honor at Speaker A's wedding. Speaker B feels like they put their heart and soul into their friendship and admits to having had significant codependency issues with Speaker A for a considerable part of their friendship. However, for at least the entire second half of their friendship, it has felt very unbalanced to Speaker B, sometimes because Speaker B tends to invest too much in relationships, perhaps to a degree that was unfair to expect in return. When friends have problems, Speaker B will drop everything to help them, wanting them to be successful and happy. Speaker B felt they did not receive that same level of support in return.\n\nMore recent information: Speaker A had twin boys two and a half years ago, just a couple of months after Speaker B had to move back home. Speaker B was devastated not to be there, as they had talked extensively about how they would be involved in the boys' lives. Speaker B is their godmother and had discussed providing free or cheap childcare. Speaker B was very close to flying over, ignoring all job responsibilities, to be with Speaker A when she gave birth and when the boys had to be in the NICU due to being premature. The only real reason Speaker B did not go was that their wife was already out of town for a funeral, and one of their dogs has aggression issues that made boarding or finding last-minute dog sitters impossible. However, Speaker B did fly over for almost a full month nearly two months after the boys were born to help care for them\u2014doing overnights, feeding them, changing diapers, babysitting, and anything else they could to assist.\n\nSince then, Speaker B has visited. Notably, in their entire friendship, Speaker A has never visited Speaker B. Speaker B visited Speaker A twice as a teenager before moving closer to her and a couple of times after moving.\n\nThe crux of the issue: Speaker B gave birth earlier this month. Their baby was incredibly premature, at only 22 weeks gestation. Speaker B texted Speaker A while in the hospital to explain what was happening, that they were being discharged, and that their baby had been transferred to a level 4 NICU. Speaker B followed their baby to the secondary hospital only a few hours after birth and operated on basically no sleep while their baby fought for her life. After 24 hours of a lot of hecticness, Speaker B noticed that Speaker A had never responded and did not check up on them. Meanwhile, Speaker B's wife had her sister checking up on her, and a local friend had come to the hospital to visit. Speaker B was furious and upset\u2014probably due to lack of sleep, but also because they had always felt that Speaker A did not show up for them during difficult times, as Speaker A always seemed to have harder problems, and Speaker B often had to set aside their feelings to make Speaker A feel better. Speaker B thought that surely, with their baby fighting for her life and having gone through a very traumatic birth, this situation would finally warrant Speaker A's attention. Then, 44 hours after the baby was born, she passed away. Speaker B posted on Facebook to announce this later that day. Speaker A left a heart and sent an extremely basic condolence message. Speaker B admits they did not respond, feeling they had a good excuse for being busy.\n\nSpeaker B did not hear back from Speaker A again for two weeks. There was no check-up or contact. After just a couple of days, Speaker B was already angry and was waiting to see how long it would take Speaker A to reach out. Then, two days ago, Speaker A sent a message claiming to be supportive and stating that she was there for Speaker B. Speaker B was again angry because they knew how ineffective Speaker A's support was at this point.\n\nSpeaker B included screenshots of their entire text conversation from the moment Speaker A found out about the baby\u2019s death to Speaker B's message. Speaker B feels lost, already grieving their daughter, and is devastated at the thought of possibly losing their best friend as well over this situation. Speaker B cannot handle so much loss at once.", "c1_input": "Speaker A reached out to Speaker B expressing love and support after seeing a post, but Speaker B revealed they were struggling deeply with grief after losing a baby and felt abandoned by Speaker A during their time of need. Speaker B expressed feelings of anger and disappointment, citing a pattern of lack of support from Speaker A in the past. Despite acknowledging their emotional instability, Speaker B conveyed that they were unsure if their friendship could be repaired.", "c2_input": "Speaker A: I just saw your post I'm so sorry I love you guys\nSpeaker A: Hey How are you doing?\nSpeaker B: I'm alive\nSpeaker A: That's all you can do sometimes and that's enough I love you and I'm here to talk even if it's just screaming or incoherent rambling No judgement\nSpeaker B: It's been the worst two weeks of my life so far. Every night I remember what it felt having a baby push their way through stitches to be born 18 weeks early at home with no medication, and then I cry because the pain would be worth it because my baby should be here but there's nothing here.

{"id": "1n70snp", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B is feeling uneasy about her fianc\u00e9, Dylan, because he didn\u2019t inform her that he was visiting his ex\u2019s house super early in the morning.\n\nSpeaker B types the entire post in upper case for easier readability and apologizes for the length, admitting that she sometimes includes unnecessary details in her stories. She explains that this is a burner account since Dylan and their friends all use Reddit and have access to her main account.\n\nSpeaker B, an 18-year-old female, is engaged to her fianc\u00e9, a 26-year-old male named Dylan. They have been dating for two years, and he recently proposed on her birthday in June, which was a sweet moment shared with both of their families and friends, making it the best birthday present she could have asked for. Speaker B still gets butterflies thinking about that day. Fast forward to September, school has recently started in her state, and Dylan works as a teacher at her old high school, where he was a teaching assistant when she was a student. Since summer break is over, he leaves earlier in the mornings before she wakes up, which doesn\u2019t bother her. School starts at 7:05 am, so he needs to be there by at least 6:25 am, typically leaving around 6:00 am to avoid traffic. Speaker B has gotten used to waking up without him being there, but she has decided to start waking up earlier to surprise him with breakfast, like a toasted bagel with egg, ham, and cheese, along with coffee. Since Dylan pays for the bills in his own home, she feels it\u2019s the least she can do to make breakfast when he leaves and prepare dinner when he comes home, although she lives with her parents and isn\u2019t at his house all the time.\n\nYesterday, Speaker B woke up around 5:00 am to make him breakfast, as she usually does when she has time. However, when she went downstairs, she found him already sitting on the couch putting on his shoes, which confused her because he usually wakes up around that time too. She asked Dylan why he was dressed so early, and he seemed startled to see her. He explained that he had to go in early to fill in for another teacher who was going to be absent that day. Speaker B was confused and asked why they couldn\u2019t just get a substitute teacher and who would fill in for his own class. Dylan said the school would take care of it but that he needed to leave earlier to \u201cprepare\u201d for it. When she asked about breakfast, he told her he would just stop at a gas station to grab something quick on the way. Speaker B was so sleepy that she didn\u2019t remember much else he said because he kissed her forehead, and before she opened her eyes again, he was out the door. Confused, she went back to sleep. Later, when she woke up again, she thought about why he couldn\u2019t just leave at his usual time if he needed to be a substitute and why the school couldn\u2019t get a substitute to cover that class. Having attended that school since middle school in 2018, she knew they had a regular set of substitute teachers, and it was rare for a teacher to cover another teacher\u2019s class.\n\nSpeaker B felt upset with herself for not bringing this up earlier in their text messages, as she was emotional and not thinking clearly at the time. For context, \u201cLauren,\u201d a 24-year-old female, is Dylan\u2019s ex-girlfriend. They dated for seven years from 2015 to 2021, meaning they were already together before she moved to their state in 2017, and Lauren is also a family friend. Dylan stated that the lockdown during the pandemic made them realize they were incompatible, and they split on good terms in 2021, just two years before he asked Speaker B out. Dylan, Lauren, and their two other friends, Anna, a 25-year-old female, and Anna\u2019s husband, Josh, a 28-year-old male, are all in the same friend group, which Speaker B believes is relevant.\n\nOn the same day Dylan left super early, Lauren invited them over to her place to watch a movie in the afternoon. While there, Speaker B experienced intense pre-period cramps, and Lauren suggested she go into her bedroom and the bathroom to take some ibuprofen. While in the bedroom, Speaker B noticed something familiar on the dresser\u2014Dylan\u2019s glasses. He had left the house that morning wearing them, and she recognized them as his. Unsure of what to do, she grabbed the glasses, took the ibuprofen, and headed downstairs. She asked Lauren why Dylan\u2019s glasses were on her dresser, and Lauren, Anna, and Josh all fell silent, which threw Speaker B off. \n\nLauren shrugged and told Speaker B to return the glasses to Dylan if she went to his house. Speaker B looked at Anna and Josh, confused by their silence and their refusal to look at her when Lauren casually mentioned to Anna, not her, that Dylan had to come by to pick up something, and all three of them agreed, which felt strange. Normally, Speaker B wouldn\u2019t have cared if Dylan went over to Lauren\u2019s place because he is an adult and can do what he wants, and they are all friends with Lauren. However, finding his glasses on the dresser beside Lauren\u2019s bed felt odd, and the way her friends reacted when she brought it up felt weird. She ended up going home early because she didn\u2019t feel well and called Dylan to ask why he left his glasses there and why he lied about where he was going. She would have been fine with him going; she just didn\u2019t understand why he had to lie and not tell her. Dylan responded that he \u201cdidn\u2019t need this from her right now\u201d and hung up, which made Speaker B burst into tears because he had never hung up on her before. This led to a tense text exchange between them. Speaker B is currently at her parents\u2019 house instead of Dylan\u2019s because he is refusing to speak to her about this situation. He feels upset that she would accuse him of something like this, and their friends are siding with him. Anna reached out to Speaker B, calling her to say that she understands this is her first relationship, but she can\u2019t just accuse the person she is going to marry of cheating. Josh agreed, stating that she was being childish and acting immaturely. Dylan echoed the same sentiment, and Lauren is refusing to speak to Speaker B because she is hurt that Speaker B would think she would do something behind her back. They all believe Speaker B is being childish and overreacting over nothing, but she is unsure. An online friend of hers suggested it was strange and that she should check Dylan\u2019s phone, but Speaker B doesn\u2019t want to be a jealous girlfriend. \n\nSpeaker B feels lost and exhausted, struggling with the reactions of her friends and fianc\u00e9, and is questioning whether she has caused trouble.", "c1_input": "Speaker B apologized for their earlier behavior and expressed a desire to talk, but Speaker A was unable to due to work commitments.

And yeah, sorry if this post is unnecessarily long, I\u2019m a bad storyteller and sometimes put unnecessary details in my stories. :(\n\nAgain, sorry for the long post, I tried my best to break it up into paragraphs. :((\n\nFYI this is a burner account because my fianc\u00e9 and our friends all use Reddit and have my account. We all follow each other.\n\nOkay, so I (18F) am engaged to my fianc\u00e9 (26M), we\u2019ll call him Dylan. Dylan and I have been dating for 2 years and he recently proposed on my birthday in June. It was super sweet and both of our families and friends were present and it was probably the best birthday present I could\u2019ve asked for. Seriously, I still get butterflies thinking about it. Now, fast forward to September. School has recently started not too long ago for my state and my fianc\u00e9 works as a teacher at my old high school. Don\u2019t worry, he wasn\u2019t a teacher then, he was just a TA. We barely even saw each other. However, since summer break is over, this means he\u2019s gone earlier in the mornings before I wake up which doesn\u2019t bother me. School starts at 7:05 am on the dot, so he has to be there by at least 6:25 am. He typically leaves at around 6:00-ish because the school isn\u2019t too far from his house and the traffic never usually starts until like around 6:30. School started in August, so I\u2019ve started getting used to waking up and him not being there. However, I\u2019ve decided to start waking up earlier and surprising him with some form of breakfast. Nothing fancy, just a toasted bagel with egg, ham, and cheese in between and a coffee to go with it. Since Dylan pays for the bills in his own home, I figured the least I could do is make breakfast when he leaves and make some sort of dinner when he comes home if I am home. Like I said, I live with my parents, so I\u2019m not at his house all the time. However, yesterday, I woke up at around 5:00 am to make him breakfast, like I always do whenever I have the time. But, when I went downstairs, he was already sitting on the couch and pulling his shoes on which really confused me because normally he\u2019s just waking up around that time too.\n\nI asked Dylan why he was dressed so early and he looked kind of startled to see me but he told me he has to go in early to fill in for another teacher who was going to be absent that day. I was confused and asked why they couldn\u2019t just get a substitute teacher and asked who was going to fill in for his own class. He said the school would take care of it but they told him he needed to fill in for this teacher\u2019s class and that he has to leave earlier to \u201cprepare\u201d for it or something. I asked Dylan, \u201cWhat about breakfast?\u201d And he told me that he\u2019ll just stop at a gas station and grab something quick on the way. I was honestly so sleepy, I didn\u2019t even remember what else he said because he just kissed my forehead and before I opened my eyes again, he was out the door. I was so confused, I just went back to sleep. But, when I woke up again way later, I thought about it and wondered why he couldn\u2019t just leave at his usual time if he needed to be a substitute? And why the school couldn\u2019t just get a substitute to cover that class? I literally went to that school since middle school in 2018 and I know that they have a regular set of substitute teachers. It\u2019s to the point where me and my friends used to memorize which subs were strict and which ones were more chill. So, a teacher covering another teacher\u2019s class has literally never happened and if it has, it\u2019s super rare. I\u2019m upset with myself for not bringing this up earlier in the text messages, but I was pretty emotional and not thinking clearly at the time. For context, \u201cLauren\u201d (24F) is his ex-girlfriend. They dated for 7 years from 2015-2021 so they were already a thing before I even moved to our state in 2017 and Lauren is actually a family friend. Dylan said that lockdown during the pandemic made them realize they were just incompatible and they split on good terms in 2021, just two years before Dylan asked me out. Dylan, Lauren, and our two other friends Anna (25F) and Anna\u2019s husband, Josh (28M) are all in the same friend group by the way. Yes, this matters. \n\nBasically, the same day he had left super early, Lauren invited us over to her place to watch a movie in the afternoon. While we were there just talking, I had these really intense pre-period cramps and Lauren told me to go into her bedroom and into the bathroom where the medicine was so I could take some ibuprofen. While I was in the bedroom, I saw something familiar on the dresser. They were Dylan\u2019s glasses. He left the house that morning with his glasses on and I knew they were his glasses because they were just recognizable. I know I sound crazy but those glasses couldn\u2019t have been anybody else\u2019s but Dylan\u2019s. I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I grabbed them, got the ibuprofen and headed downstairs. I asked Lauren why Dylan\u2019s glasses were on her dresser and Lauren, Anna, and Josh all got super quiet. I was super thrown off by the way all three of them just stared at me.\n\nLauren just shrugged and told me to return them to Dylan if I went to his house. I looked to Anna and Josh because I was confused why they were so quiet and refusing to look at me when Lauren just casually mentioned to Anna, not me, that Dylan had to come by to pick up something and all three of them agreed which felt super weird. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t have cared if Dylan went over to Lauren\u2019s place because he\u2019s an adult and he can do whatever he wants and we\u2019re all friends with Lauren but the dresser beside Lauren\u2019s bed was a weird place to find his glasses. Also the way my friends acted when I brought it up felt weird. I ended up going home early because I didn\u2019t feel too well. I ended up calling Dylan and asking why he left his glasses there and why he lied and didn\u2019t tell me that that was where he was going. I would\u2019ve been fine if he had gone, I just don\u2019t get why he had to lie and not tell me. Dylan said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t need this from me right now\u201d and then hung up on me. I burst into tears because never has Dylan ever hung up on me. Then that whole text exchange between me and Dylan happened. I\u2019m at my parents\u2019 house right now instead of Dylan\u2019s because he is refusing to speak to me over this. He feels upset that I would accuse him of something like this and our friends are siding with him. Anna reached out to me. She called me and told me that she understands that this is my first relationship but I can\u2019t just accuse the person I\u2019m going to marry of cheating. Josh also agreed and said that I was being childish and acting immaturely. Dylan also said the same thing and Lauren is refusing to speak to me because she\u2019s super hurt that I would ever think she would do that behind my back. They all think I am being childish and overreacting over nothing, but I don\u2019t know. My other friend (18F) who is an online friend told me that it\u2019s weird and that I should check his phone but I don\u2019t want to be a jealous girlfriend.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I overreacting? Please tell me because all of my friends and my fianc\u00e9 are super upset with me and I\u2019m starting to wonder if I caused trouble. I know I shouldn\u2019t care if Dylan goes over to Lauren\u2019s house because we are all friends but I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t tell me. I feel like I\u2019m crazy because my entire friend group is saying I\u2019m making something out of nothing and that I\u2019m doing too much. I just don\u2019t know anymore and I\u2019m so tired. :("}

{"id": "1h78cw2", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B is reflecting on a situation involving a text that Speaker A sent. Firstly, this came out of nowhere. When Speaker A started talking about how Speaker B is immature, Speaker B wasn\u2019t sure what to do, so Speaker B just reiterated what they are doing with their life.\n\nSpeaker B is working full-time and pursuing an MBA, albeit online.\n\nFor context, Speaker B and Speaker A started dating under romantic circumstances; Speaker A is not a sugar daddy. Speaker A looks really young, so Speaker B was truly shocked to learn his age. Now, Speaker B sees it as a mistake, so they do not want to be heckled for this.\n\nSpeaker A is older than Speaker B by 20 years. Speaker B is 25, and Speaker A is 45. Speaker A owns a restaurant, and Speaker B does remote admin work at a small startup.\n\nAfter dating for just under a year, Speaker A asked Speaker B to move in with him, as Speaker B was stressing about a recent rent increase. Speaker B could pay it, but it wrecked their financial planning and was miserable. Speaker B was looking for an out, as their rent went from $1850 to $2300, not including utilities.\n\nSpeaker A owns his house, so he told Speaker B they could live with him if they wanted. He said that Speaker B could live there and save up money, and that they could leave whenever they wanted, with no pressure. He invited Speaker B; Speaker B did not ask nor imply they wanted to move in.\n\nSpeaker B agreed (which they now consider a horrible mistake). They moved in, and now they are in this situation. Speaker A doesn\u2019t make Speaker B cover any utilities or charge rent, which Speaker B thought was kind of him.\n\nSpeaker B uses their work phone for work but is usually lying down. When they have a meeting, they sit up and answer the call. Speaker B is a solid employee, just doing backup admin work. The pay is nice; they can\u2019t complain.\n\nSpeaker A started saying that Speaker B needs to step it up in life after seeing them \u2018leisurely working.\u2019 Speaker B chose this job because they worked on their feet since high school, during their undergrad, and a bit of their current MBA. They wanted to pivot to a more relaxed job. Speaker B chose this job because it is leisurely. They are working from 9 am to about 5 pm, whereas Speaker A works from 5 pm to 5 am. So, from Speaker A\u2019s perspective, Speaker B is often asleep or unavailable.\n\nToday, Speaker A walked downstairs to work and saw Speaker B sitting on the couch. Speaker B has told him many times that they are working via their phone. Speaker A doesn\u2019t seem to understand that and makes weird little jabs.\n\nThen, Speaker A sent Speaker B these messages.\n\nSpeaker B felt really annoyed because Speaker A implied that they are not interested in self-improvement, that they are immature, and that they are arrogant, while denying that it\u2019s hurtful to say such things.\n\nBy the final slide, Speaker B decided to call their mom, who they felt could offer insight. Speaker B\u2019s mom is 40 years older than them but understands technology. She said it seems like Speaker A is trying to play some kind of game and suggested that Speaker B should just ask him why he\u2019s asking all this now. Speaker B agreed that Speaker A seems to be beating around the bush.\n\nSo, Speaker B decided to ask Speaker A why he is treating them like this.\n\nWhen Speaker A said he\u2019s talking to Speaker B like an adult, outside of text, Speaker B exploded inside.

Then, when he started talking about how I\u2019m immature, I wasn\u2019t sure what to do, so I just reiterated what I\u2019m doing with my life. \n\nWorking full-time and doing a MBA, albeit online. \n\nFor context, he and I started dating under romantic circumstances, he\u2019s not a SD. He looks really young, so I was truly shocked to learn his age. Now I see it\u2019s a mistake, so don\u2019t heckle me for this. \n\nHe is older than me, by 20 years. I am 25 and he is 45. He owns a restaurant and I do remote admin work at a small startup. \n\nAfter dating for just under a year, he asked me to move in with him, as I was stressing about my recent rent increase. I could pay it, but it wrecked my financial planning and it was miserable. I was looking for an out. My rent went from $1850 to $2300, not including utilities. \n\nHe owns his house, so he told me I could live with him if I wanted. He said that I could live here and save up my money, that I can leave whenever I want. No pressure. He invited me, I did not ask nor imply I wanted to move in. \n\nI agreed (horrible mistake). I moved in and now we\u2019re here. He doesn\u2019t make me cover any utilities or charge me rent, which I thought was kind of him. \n\nI use my work phone for work but I\u2019m usually lying down. When I have a meeting, I sit up and answer the call. I\u2019m a solid employee, just doing backup admin work. The pay is nice, can\u2019t complain. \n\nHe started saying I need to step it up in life, after seeing me \u2018leisurely working.\u2019 I chose this job because I worked on my feet since high school, my undergrad, and a bit of my current MBA. I wanted to pivot to a chill job. I chose this job because it is leisurely. I am working from 9am to about 5pm, whereas he works 5pm to 5am. So from his perspective, I\u2019m often asleep or unavailable.\n\nToday, he walked downstairs to work and saw me sitting on the couch. I\u2019ve told him many times I\u2019m working via my phone. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that and makes weird little jabs. \n\nThen, he sent me these messages. \n\nI felt really annoyed because he implies that I am not interested in self improvement, that I\u2019m immature, I\u2019m arrogant, denies that it\u2019s hurtful to say such. \n\nBy the final slide, I decided to call my mom who I felt could offer insight. She\u2019s 40 years older than me, but understands technology. She said it seems like he\u2019s trying to play some kind of game, that I should just ask him why he\u2019s asking all this to me now. He seems to be beating around the bush, which I agree with. \n\nSo, I decide to ask him why he\u2019s treating me like this. \n\nWhen he said he\u2019s talking to me like an adult, outside of text, I exploded inside. Immediately, I felt so angry. \n\nHe invites me to live with him, then holds it above me. He calls me all sorts of things over text, but then denies that he is saying such. He can\u2019t just say what he means. He then doubles down and says he\u2019s just worried about my maturity. \n\nBecause of this, and a conversation we had after, where he ignored all my concerns, didn\u2019t let me speak, and bulldozed the entire way, I\u2019ve decided to move out and find my own place again. He just has zero emotional intelligence. His ex-girlfriend was 50, the other one 55, and his ex-wife was his same age.

Consequently, Speaker B ended up rooming with another student, referred to as E, for the spring.\n\nOver the summer, all three of them\u2014Speaker B, Speaker A, and E\u2014agreed to room in a triple for the current year. However, E left college at the end of the last semester, so Speaker B and Speaker A remained in the triple together without incurring extra costs or buyouts. Speaker A had always been somewhat uptight and a neat freak, while Speaker B was generally agreeable and preferred to accommodate others to avoid conflict. E often acted as a mediator between Speaker B and Speaker A whenever Speaker A became upset about the room's messiness. Speaker A would also express frustration towards E for having a messy desk, clothes on the floor, and mismatched shoes.\n\nSince E's departure, Speaker A's behavior has worsened. Although both Speaker B and Speaker A are rarely in the room due to classes, practice, work, or visiting their boyfriends, Speaker B spends more time in the room than Speaker A. Speaker B cannot recall the last time Speaker A slept in the room or spent more than 30 minutes there. Speaker A frequently claims that Speaker B is never around and complains about the messes Speaker B leaves. While Speaker B acknowledges that she is messier, she cleans up after herself and keeps her messes confined to her personal areas. Speaker A has even boxed Speaker B in by taping a square around the corner where Speaker B's desk and closet are located, insisting that Speaker B cannot have a mess outside that area and constantly complains when anything touches the tape.\n\nOne night, Speaker B's boyfriend, referred to as J, was visiting, and Speaker A entered to pick up some items before heading to her boyfriend's house. Speaker B and J were playing Xbox and eating, leaving a bag and wrappers in front of them. Speaker A immediately complained, saying, \"you need to make sure you clean up that mess,\" using a condescending, passive-aggressive tone.\n\nSTORY:\n\nSpeaker B stayed with J for two weeks after spring break because her car broke down at home in Virginia, and her keychain, which contained her dorm key and campus ID, was inaccessible. When she finally returned last Thursday, Speaker B invited a couple of friends over for game night after their night class, an event she had invited Speaker A to multiple times, but Speaker A always had an excuse not to attend. They played drinking games in their room while Speaker A was absent, and Speaker B informed her about the gathering. The following morning, Speaker A inquired if Speaker B had seen her goose, why items on her desk were moved, and how things got out of her desk drawer. The texts reiterated that Speaker B had not touched Speaker A's belongings; the only item Speaker B moved that night was a black knit book, which she repositioned to prevent it from falling.\n\nOne friend left while Speaker B was still awake, as she lived in her van, while another friend had passed out an hour earlier, and Speaker B had covered her with a blanket. Speaker B cleaned up as best as she could, as it was the first time she had been genuinely drunk, and packed the last friend's bag to alleviate her worries about the morning. There were a couple of spills of Capri Sun and Fireball throughout the night, but they were cleaned up immediately. Speaker A sent texts complaining about the room being sticky, and Speaker B assured her that she would re-clean the entire area.\n\nE and Speaker B had scheduled a visit from Friday to Sunday, which Speaker B informed Speaker A about 1-2 weeks in advance. However, a few days before E's arrival, Speaker A announced that she had a recruit for her sport coming to visit from Friday to Saturday. Speaker A lectured Speaker B about not drinking, smoking, cursing, or making jokes around the recruit, stating, \"she's just a junior.\" Speaker B agreed and hid everything, despite finding it unreasonable to treat a 16/17-year-old like a child who would report inappropriate behavior. Speaker B reiterated that E would be there the entire weekend starting Friday, but Speaker A then mentioned that her mom would be visiting from Saturday to Sunday. Speaker B assured Speaker A that as long as the recruit and her mom were not both present by the time they went to sleep, there would be no issue. Speaker B offered to take the floor, allowing the recruit and Speaker A's mom to occupy the third bed while E could have Speaker B's bed.\n\nE arrived on Friday, and they hung out until the recruit came, at which point Speaker A immediately lectured both of them again. While Speaker B was on FaceTime with J, Speaker A insisted that she hang up, stating, \"I don\u2019t want him to make the recruit uncomfortable.\" Speaker B explained that they were not even talking, but Speaker A insisted, leading Speaker B to back down and end the call. By 9 PM, Speaker A was already saying that she and the recruit needed to sleep, which meant that E and Speaker B also had to sleep. Speaker B takes her Lexapro at 9 PM and Temazepam approximately 30 minutes before bed, but she could not find her medication.\n\nAs Speaker B searched for her meds, Speaker A turned off all the lights. Speaker B suggested turning on her LED lights, which are phone-controlled, since Speaker A had turned on her desk light, which was excessively bright. Speaker A agreed but kept her desk light on, so Speaker B plugged in her LEDs. Shortly after, Speaker A unplugged Speaker B's LEDs, claiming she \"doesn't like it dangling above the bed,\" despite Speaker B having secured the wires against the wall and her bunk's springs.\n\nSpeaker A continued to rush Speaker B and eventually pressured her to give up searching for her medication. Feeling overwhelmed, Speaker B climbed into her bed and began to have a breakdown, prompting her to text J, who eventually encouraged her to come over. Speaker B felt guilty about leaving E, who woke up as she was leaving around 11 PM and asked where she was going. Speaker B expressed, \"I\u2019m sad,\" and E understood. Speaker B offered her bed to E again, but E declined, stating she did not want to risk falling off the top bunk.\n\nThe next day, Speaker B returned, and E informed her that Speaker A had canceled her mom's visit because \"something came up.\" Speaker B accepted this as Speaker A's choice. J invited Speaker B to a baseball game on Sunday, and E encouraged her to go since she wanted to spend time with other friends before leaving. Speaker B found her medication and was able to sleep in the dorm with E while Speaker A was at her boyfriend's house. The following day, Speaker B left for the game, and Speaker A returned while she was away, noticing E in the room (refer to the texts where Speaker A claimed Speaker B was \"MIA\").\n\nThroughout E's visit, Speaker A continued to complain about the recruit potentially feeling uncomfortable, as if that would not be the case if E had remained in the room this semester, and she was cold and dismissive towards E. E began to feel uncomfortable, and they discussed it, agreeing that Speaker A was being unreasonable.\n\nA couple of nights ago, as Speaker B was going to bed, she heard a shattering sound. She turned over to see shiny pieces on the floor and quickly got up to clean it up. She texted Speaker A to inform her that her turtle had broken and then fell asleep. Throughout the day, Speaker A sent several texts. The picture of Speaker A's desk was taken from Speaker B's bed, showing it cluttered with breakable items at the edge, which Speaker B often pushed back to prevent anything from falling. The only three pieces of the turtle that were salvageable were the rest was shards and practically dust. Speaker B ended up with holes in her foot from cleaning up the mess.\n\nIn summary, Speaker B feels that Speaker A constantly complains about her mess, has boxed her into a limited space, believes Speaker B broke her trinkets despite her innocence, and portrays Speaker B as a bad person.", "c1_input": "Speaker B informed Speaker A that their turtle had died, which upset Speaker A as they believed it was a glass turtle that held sentimental value. Speaker A expressed frustration over the lack of an apology and accused Speaker B of being careless, while Speaker B defended themselves by stating they did not break the turtle and highlighted their efforts to keep the room clean. The conversation escalated with both parties exchanging accusations about their behavior and the state of their shared living space, ultimately leading Speaker A to suggest they could coexist for the remaining time without resolving their issues.", "c2_input": "Speaker B: POOKIE YOUR TURTLE DIED\nSpeaker A: Excuse me?

My scheduled roommate never showed up last year, so I had the room to myself. By spring semester, the college said we needed to either buy out our room or find a new roommate. R and I agreed we\u2019d room together bc she and her roommate had a falling out and her roommate moved out. Then room selection comes and R says \u201coh I roomed with someone else bc I thought you were going to buy out the room.\u201d I never said I was going to, I said my mom SUGGESTED it, but also that we\u2019d decided that it was too expensive and not worth it. I ended up rooming with E (referred to in the texts as \u201cprevious mutual roommate\u201d) for the spring.\n\nOver summer, all 3 of us (me, R, E) agreed to room in a triple for this year. E ended up leaving college at the end of last semester, so R and I stayed in the triple together (no extra costs/buy outs). R has always been kinda uptight and a neat freak, but I\u2019m generally agreeable and will just do whatever the other person wants, especially when living with them, to avoid any issues. E was usually a mediator of sorts between me and R whenever R would get upset that the room was messy. R would also get mad at E for E\u2019s desk being messy, clothes being on the floor, pairs of shows not being together, etc.\n\nSince E left, R has gotten much worse. R and I are rarely in the room, we\u2019re usually in class/practice/work or at our bfs\u2019 houses. However, I sleep here and spend more time in the room than she does. I can\u2019t remember the last time she slept here, or was even in here for more than 30min. She\u2019s always saying that *I\u2019m* the one who\u2019s never here and complains that I leave messes everywhere (I\u2019m a more messy person but I do clean up after myself and others and keep my messes confined to my personal areas). She quite literally boxed me in by taping a square around the corner where my desk/closet are and told me I \u201ccan\u2019t have a mess outside this area\u201d and constantly complains when something is *touching the tape.*\n\nMy bf (J) was here one night and R came in to pick up some things before going to her bf\u2019s house. J and I were playing Xbox and actively eating, so we had a bag and wrappers/boxes in front of both of us. R immediately complained, saying \u201cyou need to make sure you clean up that mess.\u201d She always uses this condescending, passive aggressive, \u201cjoking\u201d tone when complaining.\n\nSTORY:\n\nI stayed with my bf for 2w (he lives near my college in PA) after spring break because my car broke down at home in VA and the keychain had my dorm key and campus ID. When I finally came back last Thursday, I invited a couple friends over for game night after our night class (which I\u2019ve invited R to multiple times and she always has an excuse to not come). We played drinking games in our room, R was not there, and I let her know it was happening. The next morning, I get asked if I\u2019ve seen R\u2019s goose, why things are moved on her desk, how things got out of her desk drawer, etc. The texts above reiterate that I didn\u2019t touch her stuff, the only thing I touched that night was the black knit book bc I moved it back from the edge of her desk so it wouldn\u2019t fall.\n\nOne friend left while I was awake (lives in her van, sleep there for the night), the other had passed out an hour prior to that and I\u2019d put a blanket on her. I cleaned up as best as I could (that was the first time I\u2019ve ever been *actually* drunk) and packed the last friend\u2019s bag so she didn\u2019t have to worry in the morning if she woke up late. There were a couple spills of caprisun and fireball throughout the night, but we cleaned them up right when they happened. R sent texts complaining about the room being sticky, and I said I\u2019d re-clean the whole area.\n\nE and I scheduled that Fri-Sun for her to come up and visit. I told R in advance (1-2w) but then a few days before E came, R said she had a recruit for her sport coming to visit from Fri-Sat. She immediately lectured me about not drinking, smoking, cursing, or making any jokes around the recruit bc \u201cshe\u2019s just a junior.\u201d I agreed and hid everything (despite thinking it\u2019s stupid to act like a 16/17yo is a toddler who will snitch if someone says \u201cfuck\u201d). I reiterated that E was here the whole weekend starting on Fri, but R then said her mom was coming for Sat-Sun. I told her that as long as the recruit and R\u2019s mom aren\u2019t both here by the time we go to sleep, it would be no issue. I told R and E that I\u2019d take the floor, the recruit and R\u2019s mom could take the 3rd bed, and E could have my bed.\n\nE came on Fri and we hung out, then the recruit came and R immediately lectured both of us (again). I was on ft with J, and R said \u201chang up on him. I don\u2019t want him to make the recruit uncomfortable.\u201d He and I weren\u2019t even talking, we were just idly on ft and neither of us were paying attention to each other. We always fall asleep on ft/discord if we\u2019re not together. I protested and told her all of this, but she still said I needed to hang up, so I backed down and ended the call. Come 9pm, R is already saying her and the recruit need to sleep, so now E and I have to also sleep. 9pm is also when I take my Lexapro, and I take Temazepam to sleep ~30min before going to bed. The issue was, I couldn\u2019t find my meds.\n\nR turned off all of the lights as I was actively looking for my meds. I suggested turning on my LEDs (phone controlled) bc she turned on her desk light (bright as hell btw). She agreed but kept her desk on so I plugged in my LEDs. Barely 2min later, she unplugs my LEDs (she often unplugs my stuff bc she \u201cdoesn\u2019t like it dangling above the bed\u201d since she\u2019s on bottom bunk and the only outlet near me is on the wall at the middle of her bed, despite me making the wires tight against the wall/my bunk\u2019s springs).\n\nR kept rushing me and pushing, and eventually made me give up looking for them. I climbed into my bed and immediately started having a breakdown, so I texted my bf and eventually he told me to come over. I felt bad leaving E and she woke up when I left (around 11ish) asking where I was going. I said \u201cI\u2019m sad\u201d and she understood. I offered her my bed again, but she said she didn\u2019t want to risk falling off the top bunk.\n\nI came back the next day and E told me R cancelled her mom coming over bc \u201csomething came up.\u201d Whatever, her choice. J invited me to a baseball game on Sun and E said I should go bc E wanted to hang out with some other friends before she left. I found my meds and was able to sleep in the dorm with E (R was at her bf\u2019s house). The next day, I left for the game and R apparently came back while I was gone and saw E in the room (refer to texts where she said I was \u201cMIA\u201d).\n\nThe entire time E was there, R kept complaining about how the recruit might feel uncomfortable (as if this wouldn\u2019t be how the room worked if E had stayed this semester) and was very short and cold towards E. E was becoming uncomfortable and we talked about it, agreeing that R was being an ass in that moment.\n\nA couple nights ago, I was going to bed and I heard a shattering sound. I turned over and saw shiny pieces on the floor and hopped down to clean it up. I texted R that her turtle broke, and then immediately fell asleep. Then these texts came throughout the day. The pic of her desk is taken from my bed. As you can see, it\u2019s cluttered with breakable things at the edge (which I\u2019m always pushing back to avoid anything falling). You can see the only 3 pieces of the turtle that were salvageable, the rest was shards and practically dust. I ended up getting holes in my foot from cleaning it up.\n\n\nTLDR; my roommate constantly complains about my mess and literally boxed me into a space, believes I broke her trinkets even tho I didn\u2019t, and makes me out to be a bad person.\n"}

Speaker A is now attempting to convince the male roommate to assert that nothing inappropriate happened.\n\nSpeaker B drove to Speaker A's house for New Year's, which is about a 20-minute drive. Before leaving, Speaker B texted Speaker A and called her while getting gas to inform her that the roads were somewhat bad, indicating that they might take a bit longer to arrive but would text or call when they got there, wanting to focus on the roads.\n\nFortunately, there were not many people on the road, and leaving at 8 PM, Speaker B arrived around 8:20 PM. Speaker B texted Speaker A to let her know they had arrived while waiting in her driveway. After not receiving a response, Speaker B texted again to ask if she had fallen asleep. When there was still no answer, Speaker B decided to walk up to the door and knock. After knocking again a bit harder, the door opened. Speaker B greeted her and walked in, took off their shoes, and headed for the stairs next to the door to check if she was sleeping.\n\nJust as Speaker B reached the stairs, they saw Speaker A walking out of her male roommate's room with the light off, wearing nothing but a pair of see-through black panties with a string at the back and a sweater.\n\nSpeaker B's expression went blank. Speaker A looked at Speaker B and said, \u201cOh shit, this looks bad,\u201d while giggling. Speaker B stood there in shock as she continued, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, he is just a friend, come to my room.\u201d After about a minute of standing there in disbelief, Speaker B went to her room and sat in a chair. Speaker A attempted to downplay the situation, insisting that nothing had happened, but Speaker B was too stunned to respond. After about three minutes of her trying to convince Speaker B that nothing inappropriate occurred, she climbed into bed and went to sleep.\n\nSpeaker B remained silent for three hours, waiting for her to wake up. Finally, just before midnight, Speaker B could no longer tolerate the situation and left.\n\nAt around 4 AM, Speaker B received a text from Speaker A apologizing for falling asleep, with no mention of her walking out of the male roommate's room in that manner.\n\nThe next three hours involved Speaker A insisting that Speaker B was mistaken, claiming that nothing happened, that she didn\u2019t cheat, and that her actions weren\u2019t highly inappropriate even if she didn\u2019t cheat. She explained that she had only gone into the room to see the dogs and charge her phone because it had died, and that she often walks around the house without pants (despite Speaker B never having seen this). Speaker A accused Speaker B of being overly emotional and much more.\n\nSpeaker A then suggested that Speaker B talk to the male roommate, who claimed to see nothing wrong with the situation. Additionally, Speaker A has mentioned that the roommate often expresses a desire to be intimate with her, yet she insists they are just friends.\n\nSpeaker B feels frustrated, especially considering they had recently discussed how Speaker A's father was cheated on by her mother and how it devastated him. Despite this, Speaker A is telling Speaker B that they are being overly sensitive.\n\nSpeaker B is left questioning whether they are overreacting, whether this should be considered cheating, and whether it is highly inappropriate regardless.

Speaker B has never once led Speaker A on and didn't think much of their friendship; in fact, Speaker B doesn't even view Speaker A as a best friend. Speaker B feels confused and offended by how Speaker A reacted to Speaker B hanging out with a guy that Speaker A doesn't know at all. Speaker B believes that Speaker A is getting overly worked up about a hangout that isn't even a big deal.\n\nThe guy in Speaker B's society is actually really sweet and friendly and has hinted that he is into Speaker B. Speaker B thinks he is amazing and wants to see how things would pan out since Speaker B is also interested, but it's only mild attraction and not a full-blown crush from either side.\n\nThe reason Speaker B stated it wasn't a date is because, first, Speaker B is actually going out to help this guy get a present. Life has been really difficult lately for Speaker B, who has been dealing with mental health issues and relationship problems and is in the process of getting a therapist before doing something drastic.

Now, Speaker B is rethinking their past interactions and whether or not Speaker A showed any interest, and if Speaker B mistakenly led Speaker A on (Speaker B literally doesn't remember a single instance like that). Now, Speaker B thinks that Speaker A asking Speaker B out in the beginning was meant to be like a date.\n\nSpeaker B feels like they are posting a little too much on Reddit lately. Honestly, Speaker B has been dealing with much more serious issues, and this situation seems tame in comparison.

{"id": "1i8rkac", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "On Saturday, Speaker B was closing with a coworker, and around 9-10 PM, Speaker A came in. He arrived around 10:12 PM and immediately approached Speaker B after greeting the coworker. He wanted to shake hands, which Speaker B did not think much of at first. He took one of Speaker B's hands and covered the other side, trapping it inside. He then used his middle finger to massage the inside of Speaker B's palm while intensely looking into Speaker B's eyes.\n\nSpeaker B separated from the situation, but when cleaning, Speaker A sat in front of the TV where they were folding. He kept looking at Speaker B, following their movements in a way that seemed to beckon them over. Speaker B distanced themselves again and moved to the office.\n\nAt this point, Speaker B did not feel safe. Speaker A moved to the chairs by the bathrooms and continued to smile at Speaker B, repeating his earlier actions. Speaker B completely avoided the area where he was and tried to \"hide.\" The next thing Speaker B knew, Speaker A approached with his underwear showing in front, his pants almost at his knees, smirking and trying to maintain eye contact. When the coworker returned, Speaker A dropped the smile, but she did not say anything. In fact, she gave him a low-key flirty smile and pushed down on his pants with her fingers. When she went to the bathroom, Speaker A kept asking for a handshake. Speaker B, not wanting to believe anything was wrong, tried to convince themselves they were delusional. They reluctantly gave him a handshake, but he did it again, this time more aggressively, using two fingers. He held Speaker B's hand a third time, obsessively calling Speaker B's name. Speaker B could see he was getting frustrated that they were not responding to his advances. He attempted a fourth time, at which point Speaker B firmly said no and moved to the back of the office, not wanting to make a scene.\n\nThe coworker approached Speaker B since earlier, Speaker B had told her she could leave early because they wanted Speaker A gone. Speaker B straight up asked her if Speaker A was drunk. She seemed confused, said no, and asked if he had done anything weird. At that point, Speaker B was already scared and freaked out, so all they could do was nod their head. She asked Speaker A what he did and then moved to him. Speaker B did not see or hear that part, but it was very quick, and they left. Speaker B, who had past trauma and had been assaulted before, was freaking out. When they got home, Speaker B texted the coworker, and she promised to never bring Speaker A back again, although she dismissed what he had done.\n\nThe next time Speaker B had a shift with the coworker, which usually lasted 5-10 minutes unless there were drops, Speaker B, feeling scared, asked another girl to be with them. When the coworker saw the other girl, she kept texting Speaker B and waited for 20-30 minutes, even though it wasn't busy. When Speaker B arrived and saw that Speaker A was there, he looked at them, but before anything could happen, Speaker B went into the office, angry. They went there because they saw the other girl, hugged her, and clocked in. Speaker B was a big hugger and affectionate person, always there for everyone, and most people preferred coming to them for issues instead of the manager. The coworker came into the office all happy and seemed to want to hug Speaker B, but Speaker B did not reciprocate and moved to the storage area, which was across the room, basically the furthest part of the whole store. Speaker B avoided and ignored her. After about 10-15 minutes, she texted Speaker B.\n\nSpeaker B felt overwhelmed and wanted to rip her hair out. Additionally, during the whole shift before Speaker A arrived, the coworker had kept trying to teach Speaker B how to ask someone for sex in Spanish and similar phrases. Even before this incident, she had been going on about how good Speaker A was in bed, completely unprovoked, with Speaker B never mentioning anything sexual to her. Speaker B thought they had cursed three times in front of her, and she had only been there for four months.\n\nIn some of the messages, it was implied that Speaker B was late, but they had never been late before. Speaker B usually arrived one hour before their shift to help out.

He wanted to shake hands which I didn't think much off. He put one hand in mine and covered the other side of my hand ( trapping it inside ) he then with his middle finger massaged the inside of my palm while intensively looking in my eyes.\n\nI separate myself from the situation, but when I'm cleaning and he's sitting in front of the tv where we fold. He keeps looking at me following where I'm going ( still sitting ) in a way calling me over. I distance myself again and move to the office.\n\nI really don't feel safe at this point, he moves spots to the chairs by the bathrooms and keeps smiling at me. And repeating actions.  I completely avoid where he is, and try to \u201c hide myself \u201c. Next thing I know he's coming with his underwear out in the front, the pants are  almost at his knees. He's smirking at me still trying to keep eye contact.  Coworker comes he drops the smile. BUT SHE DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING. In fact she low-key gives him a flirty smile and pushes down on the pants with her fingers. Then the moment she goes to either the bathroom or I don't know.  He keeps asking for a handshake, I personally didn't want to believe anything wrong was going on. I was trying to convince myself I was delusional. I give him the handshake, he does it again this time more aggressive. ( middle finger, now we have two fingers) He has my hand the third time, keeps obsessing about me calling his name.  I can see he's getting frustrated I'm not giving to his attempt.  He tries for the. Forth time at which I loudly / firmly say no and move to the back of the office. I didn't want to make a scene.\n\nShe comes to me since earlier I told her she can leave early. Since I wanted the dude gone!( at that moment I didn't say anything about him.)\n\nAnd I straight up ask her if he was drunk. She gets confused says no and asks if he did anything weird and since I was already scared at that point and freaked out all I could do is nodd my head. She asks him what he did and then moved to him. I didn't see or hear that part. But they were very quick, they leave. I have past trauma and I have been assaulted before and I'm freaking out. When I come home I text her and she promises to never bring him back again. ( she dismisses what he did )\n\nNext time I have a shift with her ( shift transfer and that's usually 5-10 minutes unless we have drops. And I'm usually always alone.)  that time since I was scared I asked another girl to be with me. And when she saw the other girl she kept on texting me, and she waited like 20-30 minutes even though it wasn't busy. When I come and saw he was there, he looked at me but before anything I went into our office angry as hell. I went there because I saw the other girl so I hugged her and clocked in. I'm a big hugger and effection shower, I'm always there for everyone. And most people prefer coming to me for issues instead of the manager.  She comes in the office all happy and shit, I can tell she wants to hug me and bla bla bla. I don't do it I move to the storage which is across the room basically the furthest part of the whole store. I avoid and ignore her.  After that like 10-15 minutes she texts me this.\n\n\nAnd I don't know what to do. I want to rip her hair out.\n\nAnd also, during the whole shift before her husband come in.  She kept trying to teach me how to ask someone to f me in Spanish and similar words. And even before including today she kept going on about how good he is in bed. Completely unprovoked and with me never mentioning anything sexual to her! I think I cussed 3 times in front of her, she's been there 4 months.\n\nAnd also in some of the ss its kinda implicated I'm late and bla bla bla. Never been late before, I usually come 1 h before my shift to help out. Always. But last time she worked I come exactly at 8:00. And that's my clock in"}

{"id": "1nnhhwh", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B's (M27) girlfriend (F27) told Speaker B that he was overreacting about her male friend sending money to her behind his back.\n\nSpeaker B provided a quick summary of what happened before this, in short detail.\n\nAs they were coming off the tail of previous tension and making up, Speaker B told his girlfriend that he had two hard boundaries: that he was very uncomfortable with his partner bringing their friends into their relationship details in the middle of their arguments, and that he was very uncomfortable with the idea of another man sending money or buying things for his partner. To Speaker B, these things were very reasonable to ask of a partner, and he believed she was on board with this prior, as he had asked these things of her before and she had respected them up to that point.\n\nThough this time, she told Speaker B that she wasn\u2019t sure she agreed with these boundaries and needed to think about it. He told her that these were very important to him, and he was not comfortable continuing things if she could not respect him at the most basic level. She offered to sleep in the other room, and he agreed it was for the best right now to give them space to think.\n\nFast forward a couple of days, Speaker B woke up to her sheepishly asking to lay in bed with him. She told him she had been feeling sick, most likely because she had a day of missed antidepressants, lack of food, and an unexpected reaction with other recent medication. After acting nice to him, she asked him directly if he could take her back up to McDonald\u2019s to get her a cheeseburger and a sweet tea. She had asked him to do this the day prior, and he drove her up to use her points because he wanted her to feel better and loved her regardless of their fighting. However, lately, his finances had been increasingly strained, as he had been supporting them both entirely with bills, medication, food, transportation, and fun things for them to share. She had been staying at his house for eight months unemployed, smoking weed while he had been providing and looking out for her every need.\n\nIn response to her asking him for more McDonald\u2019s, Speaker B shared that finances were extremely low for him right now and that he would feel more comfortable if she\u2019d try to use her points again or make something at home instead. But she told him the only thing she was craving was a cheeseburger and sweet tea and could not eat anything else without getting sick from her medication-induced nausea. She then directly asked him if a friend, let\u2019s call him A, could cover her meal with his points instead. The previous tension they had been working through revolved around A, so Speaker B told her that he did not feel comfortable with that and that it could be something to discuss at a later time. She then sat silently for a moment without responding.\n\nSome quick backstory about A: he was a married man who had been constantly offering to cover various things for Speaker B's girlfriend, such as offering to buy any desk she chose on Amazon, no questions asked. Before that, this man had blocked her on Discord because he had trash-talked his wife to Speaker B's girlfriend in her DMs, so it was assumed his wife made him block her for two years. It wasn\u2019t until recently that he randomly unblocked her and began talking to her throughout the day, even into the early mornings between 2-6 am while Speaker B was sleeping. There was even a point when she was speaking to him daily much more than to Speaker B for a few weeks straight. Speaker B voiced his discomfort with him constantly wanting to send her money and how much attention she gave another man while ignoring her boyfriend. He thought that she had set this boundary with him and agreed to respect their relationship.\n\nSo flash forward to now. Speaker B's girlfriend then told him she\u2019d start \u201clooking through her accounts to see if she had any money laying around,\u201d then went to the bathroom with her phone. When she returned, she had a story lined up about how she \u201cfound $5 randomly on Robinhood and transferred it immediately to her PayPal.\u201d This didn\u2019t add up to Speaker B, since he knew there was no direct transfer from Robinhood to PayPal. He mentioned this in passing, and she stuttered a bit uncomfortably and dropped it. The drive to McDonald\u2019s was very awkward and quiet, and he figured something was up.\n\nBefore they got home, Speaker B directly asked his girlfriend if she would ever lie to him about small things like this. She then immediately confessed to lying to his face, as her friend had indeed covered the meal, and she used the funds left over from his previous PayPal sends to fund the sweet tea. She later informed him that he had been sending her money for various things for at least a couple of weeks before this, all without his knowledge or comfort even being considered. She even had the audacity to say that him not getting her the McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger and tea was showing her he \u201cdidn\u2019t care about what she was going through\u201d and that she was \u201csuffering\u201d because of it, and that was why it was okay to lie to him about her friend sending her money without his knowledge. She said it was out of necessity, but as she admitted before, he had been sending her money for other things weeks before. She refused to tell him what exactly he was buying her, which Speaker B felt told him all he needed to know.\n\nAfter hearing this, Speaker B honestly felt hurt and betrayed. He felt disposable because he was uncomfortable giving his girlfriend money he did not have at the time. So he simply told her he would no longer be providing anything for her and locked himself in his room. They had a blowout of yelling between them for a few minutes shortly after, which he honestly regretted and has since apologized for. But the above screenshots are from his (ex?) girlfriend regarding the situation, saying that he was not experienced enough to know that his expectations were irrational. Speaker B agreed that he should find someone who respects these boundaries, but he felt that these were rather tame requests he had for her, and it was shocking that she couldn\u2019t care about him at a basic level to agree to them.\n\nSpeaker B loved his (ex?) girlfriend, and it pained him that she betrayed his trust like this, even over something as trivial as a cheeseburger. But he genuinely worried that if she was okay with lying to him over something so small, then what would she be okay with lying to him about in the future if he stayed with her?\n\nIn summary, Speaker B questioned whether it was really that uncommon for boyfriends to ask their girlfriends not to have their guy friends spoil them with money or goods, and to avoid trash-talking their boyfriends to their friends (especially other men). He wondered if these things were rather common requests between partners.\n\nAdditionally, Speaker B wanted to clarify that he thought sending friends gifts on holidays, special occasions, birthdays, or normal types of friendly gestures was perfectly normal and he wouldn\u2019t have a problem with that. He just found it unacceptable that she was constantly offered money, lied about receiving money for at least two weeks from a married man behind his back, and shared all of their relationship conflict details while bad-mouthing him.", "c1_input": "Speaker A expressed feelings of hopelessness and a desire to end the relationship, emphasizing the need for change and compromise from Speaker B.

She even had the audacity to say that me not getting her the McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger and tea was showing her I \u201cdidn\u2019t care about what she was going through\u201d and that she was \u201csuffering\u201d because of it, and that\u2019s why it was ok to lie to me about her friend sending her money without my knowledge. She says it was out of necessity, but as she admitted before, he had been sending her money for other things weeks before. She refuses to tell me what exactly he was buying her, which I feel tells me all I need to know. \n\nAfter hearing this I honestly felt hurt and betrayed. Like I was disposable because I was uncomfortable giving my girlfriend money I did not have at the time. So I simply told her I would no longer be providing anything for her and locked myself in my room. We had a blowout of yelling between us for a few minutes shortly after, which I honestly do regret and have since apologized for. But the above screenshots are from my (ex?) girlfriend regarding the situation, saying that I am not experienced enough to know that my expectations are irrational. I do agree that I should find someone who respects these boundaries, but I feel that these are rather tame requests I had for her and it\u2019s shocking that she couldn\u2019t care about me at a basic level to agree to them.\n\nI love my (ex?) girlfriend and it pains me that she betrayed my trust like this, even over something as stupid as a cheeseburger. But I genuinely worry that if she was okay with lying to me over something so small, then what would she be okay with lying to me about in the future if I stay with her? \n\nTLDR: Is it really that uncommon for boyfriends to ask their girlfriends not to have their guy friends spoil them with money or goods, and to avoid trash talking their boyfriends to their friends (especially other men)? Or are these things rather common requests between partners? \n\nP.S.: I\u2019d also like to add that I think sending friends gifts on holidays, special occasions, birthdays, or normal types of friendly gestures is perfectly normal and I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with that. I just find constantly offering to send money, lying about receiving money for at least two weeks from a married man behind my back, and telling him all of our relationship conflict details and bad talking me is not acceptable.

Speaker B also offered to assist with pacing or narrative, as that is where they excel.\n\nThe next day, Speaker B informed their class teacher about the situation, but instead of support, the teacher called Speaker B selfish for abandoning the team over what she considered a small matter like a certificate.

They have been together for 3 years and share a large number of mutual friends on Facebook. The city they live in has a close-knit service industry, and most people know each other. Speaker B has worked at several of the most popular bars in the city, and Speaker A goes out frequently. Therefore, it has never bothered Speaker B that they have many mutual Facebook friends. However, Speaker A has a history of drunkenly cheating on Speaker B, an issue they have moved on from. This particular situation feels strange to Speaker B.\n\nWhat happened: While scrolling through Facebook's \"people you may know,\" Speaker B noticed a younger girl (21) pop up, and their only mutual friends are Speaker A and one of his friends. Upon clicking on her page, Speaker B discovered that she works at a local bar as well and recognized her from previous visits. Speaker A occasionally goes to this bar.\n\nThe problem Speaker B has: Due to the lack of mutual friends, Speaker B does not believe this girl is sending mass friend requests to people she has seen. Speaker B suspects that Speaker A went out of his way to add her. It is also relevant that Speaker A does not post on Facebook at all; he is more of a lurker.\n\nHaving bartended for 8 years, Speaker B recalls that at 21, she would have accepted requests from bar regulars to help build a following. However, upon reflection, she realizes how creepy and inappropriate that behavior can be.\n\nAfter contemplating how this situation made her feel, Speaker B believes it is unacceptable for a man with a girlfriend to add his bartender on social media, especially given the age gap. She questions what they have in common and what the purpose of adding her could be.\n\nSpeaker B attempted to ask Speaker A for clarity on the situation.

I actually met my boyfriend (39F) from serving him at a local bar. We\u2019ve been together for 3 years and have a large amount of mutual friends on Facebook. The city we live in has a close service industry and most people know each other. I\u2019ve worked at a handful of the most popular bars in the city and he goes out a lot. So It has never bothered me that we have a ton of mutual Facebook friends. My boyfriend also has a history of drunkenly cheating on me. (Something we have moved on from). But this situation seems weird to me? \ud83d\udea9\n\nWhat happened: When I see Facebook\u2019s \u201cpeople you may know know\u201d I always take a second to glance at it while scrolling. And this time a younger girl (21) popped up and our only mutual friends are my bf and one of his friends. I click on her page to discover she works at a local bar as well and I recognize her (she\u2019s served me before). My bf time to time goes to this bar. \n\nThe problem I have: Due to the lack of mutual friends I don\u2019t think this girl is on Facebook sending mass requests to people she\u2019s seen. So I have a feeling my boyfriend went out of his way to add her. He does not post on Facebook at all he\u2019s just a lurker (sorta important info). \n\nI\u2019ve been bartending for 8 years and I know when I was 21 I would\u2019ve accepted requests from bar regulars to help build a following. Looking back though I realize how creepy and not okay it was. \n\nAfter thinking about how this made me feel\u2026I feel it is unacceptable for a man with a girlfriend to add his bartender on social media. (Especially with this age gap). What do they have in common? What even is the purpose of adding her? \n\nI tried asking him for some clarity. Should I have approached this differently? I\u2019m sure. But with our history, I\u2019d like to just get straight to the point. Am I over reacting? Is this something that continues to be normal? Do you let your S/Os add whoever? I think I\u2019m just grossed out by the age difference. If this was a 40 year old Female bartender would it make me feel more at ease? Probably. "}

{"id": "1lwfx8v", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B is a 40-year-old male on a road trip on the east coast with Speaker A, a 12-year-old male child. They are parked at a campground in the middle of upstate New York at 10:30 PM, sitting in the front seat of a rental van just about to settle down for the night. Speaker B hears the phone ringing and sees that it\u2019s a friend he hasn\u2019t heard from in a long time. He hasn\u2019t seen this friend, whom he will refer to as Peter, in over 20 years, and they talk maybe once every three years. Their conversations typically revolve around reminiscing about their high school days, and honestly, Speaker B doesn\u2019t know much about Peter\u2019s current life, nor does Peter know much about Speaker B\u2019s. Peter was one of two good friends with whom Speaker B spent a lot of time during the first couple of years of high school, but he was 5-6 years older and had already graduated. To this day, Speaker B and the other friend do not know Peter\u2019s real first name, as they have always called him by a nickname.\n\nSpeaker B answers the phone and can hear that Peter is in a bad place. Peter still lives in the Midwest in the same exact house where they used to get high together. His wife is pregnant, and he didn\u2019t want another child, but she did after experiencing many miscarriages. Their other child is the same age as Speaker B's. Peter hasn\u2019t worked in seven months and is seriously in debt, putting everything on credit cards, as he claims, and is two months behind on his mortgage. The call lasts an hour, during which Speaker B talks Peter down from suicidal thoughts and feels he has given him hope to find a job or something similar. Peter explains that his wife has no idea he isn\u2019t working or that they are hundreds of thousands in debt. He feels he cannot tell her because it would stress her out and might lead to another miscarriage. Speaker B offers to help in whatever way he can, not financially, but by at least pointing Peter in the right direction. The call ends on a more positive note.\n\nThe next day, Peter calls Speaker B a couple of times and apologizes but feels he must ask to borrow $15,000. He claims that a loan shark is after him, threatening his house and family, and he is desperate. Speaker B says he will see what he can do but wants to see Peter\u2019s financial documents, including mortgage stubs, credit card statements, and bank statements. Peter becomes a little quiet and then reveals that he doesn\u2019t have a mortgage because his parents paid off the house a long time ago. Speaker B thinks this makes sense, but during their last call, Peter had mentioned being two months behind on his mortgage. When Speaker B asks for clarification, Peter explains that what he meant by mortgage is the $700 a month he pays his parents. Speaker B feels irritated because he had repeatedly told Peter that he needs to pay his mortgage to avoid losing his house, and Peter never clarified this point.\n\nFeeling that Peter may be dishonest, Speaker B decides to contact their other friend, whom he has remained in better contact with and has seen about ten times in the last 20 years. He refers to this friend as Johnny. Speaker B reaches out to Johnny and asks if he has talked to Peter lately. Johnny mentions that they spoke just a few days prior, and Peter had been asking a lot of questions about work, how much Johnny gets paid, and what else is new in life. Johnny was unaware that Peter\u2019s wife was pregnant or that Peter was having any issues. They had a normal conversation, and then Peter started asking questions about Speaker B. Johnny, knowing that Speaker B owns his own business and moved to the West Coast years ago, tells Peter about the success Speaker B has been having.\n\nAfter hearing this from Johnny, Speaker B feels very unsettled. He is unsure what to believe from Peter or if any of it is true. Johnny and Speaker B joke that they have Peter saved in their phones under the same name and that they do not know his real name. They also joke that Peter is like a ninja; despite spending so much time together when they were younger, they never really knew anything about him.\n\nPeter then sends a series of messages, and Speaker B becomes increasingly frustrated. Peter keeps calling one after the other without leaving a voicemail, and the whole situation feels very off. \n\nIn summary, Speaker B's old secretive friend calls after 20 years asking to borrow $15,000 but is not being honest with his wife or Speaker B. Peter's persistent calls and texts continue after Speaker B tells him he will see what he can do and that he will get back to him.

Speaker B acknowledges that they are young, but both Speaker B and Speaker A have completed high school and have already had a long discussion about their situation. They are both happy with their decision. Speaker A wants to work with his dad in roofing, but Speaker A's mom believes that because he played football throughout high school, he should pursue that instead. She implied that Speaker B and their baby might hold him back. \n\nSpeaker B feels confused about why they need to include Speaker A's mom in their decisions. Speaker B does not want to come off as rude, but they are both of legal age and have already discussed everything. Speaker B also feels as though Speaker A's mom is almost blaming her.

Speaker B believes this because she will teach her child not to be like them. Speaker B's child will have empathy and sympathy and will understand that in no situation should they bully or call someone out by name. \n\nSpeaker B will not be getting an abortion; it is absolutely not up to anyone but her and Speaker A.

Speaker B found a lovely young lady who seemed like an amazing candidate as she had a lot of skills and experience Speaker B was looking for. \n\nHer first day was June 12th.

Speaker B completely understands this and would never have a sick person working near patients or in the facility due to spread risk. \n\nThe second time she called out because of her dog\u2014Speaker B attached the messages below because it\u2019s too long to explain. \n\nNow, she was scheduled to work this week except Wednesday. She called out on Monday due to being ill. This is completely understandable. Speaker B will attach those messages as well because it\u2019s too long to explain. \n\nSpeaker B just needs advice. Again, it\u2019s only been a month and there is concern it will become an issue. \n\n*Also, just for background, she\u2019s a part-timer earning $25/hr, plus Speaker B provides her with the company card for all and any lunch she needs. She gets a 2-hour break every shift. Speaker B also recently paid for her training because she was interested in doing spray tanning. Speaker B told her they would pay for her education if she was able to reflect the knowledge and skills well on the clients. Speaker B proposed a 40% commission for every person she does on top of the $25/hr. \n\nSpeaker B is considering whether to send the message in the last image. They are unsure if their thoughts were well articulated or if they are being unreasonable since she could possibly be really sick. Speaker B hates being the bad guy, but they have no idea what\u2019s going on really. \n\nThank you!", "c1_input": "Speaker A initially requested to come in late due to their dog's illness, but later decided to take the day off entirely, citing feeling unwell.

I\u2019ve been expanding much quicker than expected, so I began seeking an employee. I found a lovely young lady who seemed like an amazing candidate as she had a lot of skills and experience I was looking for. \n\nHer first day was June 12th. Fast forward to now. \nShe has called out a few times in less than a month. \n\nThe first incident she was feeling sick and left early, and couldn\u2019t come in the next day. This I completely understand, I will never have a sick person working near my patients or in the facility due to spread risk. \n\nThe second time she called out because of her dog\u2014 I attached the messages below because it\u2019s too long to explain. \n\nNow, she was scheduled to work this week except Wednesday. She called out on Monday due to being ill. Completely understandable. I\u2019ll attach those messages as well because it\u2019s too long to explain. \n\nI just need advice. Again, it\u2019s only been a month and I\u2019m concerned it\u2019ll become an issue. \n\n*Also, just for background, she\u2019s a part timer earning $25/hr plus I give her the company card for all and any lunch she needs. She gets a 2hr break every shift. I also recently paid for her training because she was interested in doing spray tanning. I told her I\u2019d paid for her education if she was able to reflect the knowledge and skills well on the clients. I proposed 40% commission for every person she does on top of the $25/hr. \n\nSo, should I send the message in the last image? Did I put my thoughts well or am I being unreasonable since she could possibly be really sick? Should I wait? I hate being the bad guy, but I have no idea what\u2019s going on really. \n\n\nThank you! \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1on3ehl", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B's friends are fighting, and Speaker B has no idea what to do.\n\nSpeaker B (15F) has two friends, Layla (15 almost 16F) and Miranda (16F), who are having a total falling out, and Speaker B has been put in the middle. Last year, during Speaker B's freshman year of high school, Speaker B got really close with Layla, considering her one of Speaker B's best friends. They had a small, close-knit friend group that included Miranda. Both Miranda and Layla eventually developed feelings for each other, and Speaker B was the only one who knew about their relationship.\n\nWithin their relationship, Layla would often come to Speaker B, complaining about Miranda and expressing that she felt Miranda wasn\u2019t putting enough commitment into their relationship. Fast forward about 5 or 6 months, Layla told Speaker B that she broke up with Miranda for these reasons. Layla said they agreed to stay friends and not let their breakup affect their friend group.\n\nNow it\u2019s homecoming. Layla and Speaker B are in a homecoming group with a few friends (without Miranda) and are planning to go to an afterparty at a girl named Lauren\u2019s house. Once they arrive at the dance, Speaker B greets Miranda because they are close friends and have interconnecting friend groups. Speaker B asks Miranda if she\u2019s going to Lauren\u2019s afterparty, to which Miranda replies yes.\n\nFor the rest of the night, Speaker B hangs out with a girl named Anna. They both notice how distant Layla is being, as she avoids them the entire night. When it\u2019s time to leave, Layla is very disrespectful towards their host, Lauren, saying things like, \u201cLauren, when the fuck are your parents going to be here?\u201d and walking off without telling anyone where she\u2019s going.\n\nWhen they return to Lauren\u2019s house, Layla acts really weird and starts meditating on the floor of Lauren\u2019s bedroom, which seems like it was supposed to be humorous, so everyone leaves her alone for a bit and goes outside. Speaker B and Miranda go back into the bedroom to see if Layla wants to talk about what\u2019s wrong, and Layla completely flips out on them. She screams, \u201cGet the fuck out before I get even more fucking angry.\u201d Speaker B and Miranda share a look and then go to find an area to debrief.\n\nAfter Layla freaks out on them, she goes to the rest of the group and starts acting completely normal with them, singling out Speaker B, Miranda, and Anna for the entire night. There is so much tension that it feels like they can\u2019t talk to the rest of the people there. They make the best of their situation until it\u2019s time to leave the next morning.\n\nThe next day, Layla calls Speaker B to try and talk about everything. Layla says that Speaker B and Miranda should have known she was upset because Miranda came to the afterparty, and they were the only ones who knew the whole story. Layla expresses that she\u2019s been mad because she thinks Miranda was trying to make things go back to normal too quickly and was touching Layla too much (Miranda is a naturally touchy person). Speaker B thinks it was nothing out of the ordinary for how they usually interacted, but acknowledges that Speaker B wasn\u2019t in the relationship, so they don\u2019t know. Speaker B reassures Layla that everything will be okay and that Speaker B will give her time to resolve her feelings with Miranda.\n\nOne day after school, while walking to the gas station together, Layla tells Speaker B that she and Miranda are fine and that she has resolved her negative feelings. Speaker B feels really happy that things are going okay again, until they aren\u2019t.\n\nDuring Halloweekend, Speaker B's parents are going to give Speaker B and Layla a ride to the party at Lauren\u2019s, as long as Layla\u2019s parent can pick them up and take Speaker B back home. Miranda asks Speaker B if their parents can also take her to the party, so Speaker B first asks Layla to make sure it\u2019s okay. Layla says it\u2019s fine and thanks Speaker B for asking her.\n\nOn the day of the party, they pick up Layla, and everything is fine. Then they pick up Miranda, and suddenly Layla goes nonverbal for the rest of the car ride, which is weird. They arrive, and Layla storms up to the door without waiting for Speaker B and Miranda. Speaker B and Miranda sneak a bit of alcohol into the party, and while they both drink some, it\u2019s clear that Miranda has had more than Speaker B. Layla doesn\u2019t talk to either of them the entire party. She takes Speaker B into Lauren\u2019s room and shoves a trash bag in Speaker B's face, saying something about how she\u2019ll be super pissed if Miranda pukes in her car (which is valid) and that she\u2019s disappointed. After they drop Miranda off, when Miranda is getting out of the car, Layla turns to Speaker B and says, \u201cYou gonna walk her to the door?\u201d which feels petty but whatever. After talking to other people, Speaker B finds out that Layla was pregaming by smoking weed before the party. Speaker B feels very conflicted.", "c1_input": "Speaker A expressed feelings of growing apart from Speaker B and frustration about their lack of communication, particularly regarding a recent incident involving another friend.

two friends (15 almost 16F) and (16F) are having a total falling out and i\u2019ve been put in the middle. we\u2019ll call girl number one layla and girl number two miranda. \nok so last year (my freshman year of high school) i got really close with layla i would call her one of my best friends. we had a small close not friend group that included miranda. both miranda and layla eventually developed feeling for each other (i am the only one that knew of their relationship). \n\nwithin their relationship layla would always come to me complaining about miranda and how she feels like she doesn\u2019t put enough commitment into their relationship. so, fast forward about 5 or 6 months, layla tells me she broke up with miranda for these reasons. she says that they agreed upon staying friends and to not let their breaking up affect our friend group. \n\nso now it\u2019s homecoming. layla and i are in a homecoming group with a few friends (without miranda) and we are planning to go to an afterparty and a girl named lauren\u2019s house. once we get to the dance i greet miranda because we are close friends and have interconnecting friend groups. i ask miranda if she\u2019s going to lauren\u2019s afterparty in which she reply\u2019s yes. \n\nso for the rest of the night i hang out with a girl named anna. we have both realized how distant layla is being. she was avoiding us the entire night. then when it\u2019s time to leave she was being very disrespectful towards our host, lauren. saying things like \u201clauren when the fuck are your parents going to be here\u201d and walking off not telling anyone where she\u2019s going. \n\nthen when we got back to lauren\u2019s house she was acting really weird and meditating on the floor of lauren\u2019s bedroom (in which it seemed like it was supposed to be humorous) so everyone left her alone for a bit and went outside. me and miranda went back into the bedroom to see if she wanted to talk about what was wrong and she completely flipped the fuck out on us. she screamed \u201cget the fuck out before i get even more fucking angry\u201d me and miranda just shared a look then went to find an area to debrief. \n\nafter she freaked out on us she went to the rest of the group of people there and started acting completely normal with them. she singled out me, miranda, and anna for the entire night. there was so much tension it felt like we couldn\u2019t talk to the rest of the people there. we made the best of our situation until it was time to leave the next morning. \nso then the next day she calls me to try and talk about everything. she says that me and miranda should have known she was upset because miranda came to the after party and we were the only ones that knew the whole story. she said she\u2019s been mad because she thinks miranda was trying to make things go back to normal so quickly and was touching layla too much (miranda is a natural touchy person) it was nothing out of the ordinary for how i usually saw them (but obviously i wasn\u2019t in the relationship so idk) but i said that everything will be okay and i will give her time to resolve her feeling with miranda. \none day after school we were walking to the gas station together, layla told me that her and miranda were fine and that she had resolved her negative feelings. i was really happy that things were going okay again, until they weren\u2019t. \n\nhalloweekend. \nmy parents were going to give me and layla a ride down to the party at lauren\u2019s so longs as layla\u2019s parent could pick us up and take me back home.  miranda had asked me if my parents could also take her to the party, so first i asked layla to make sure it was ok. she said that it was fine and thanked me for asking her. \nso now it\u2019s the day of the party we pick layla up everything\u2018s fine. then we pick up miranda and suddenly layla goes nonverbal for the rest of the car ride. weird. so we arrive and layla just storms up to the door not even bothering to wait for me and miranda. ok so don\u2019t tell but miranda did sneak a bit of alcohol into the party and me and her both drank some (but you could tell she had drank more than me) and layla doesn\u2019t talk to me or miranda the entire party. she takes me into lauren room and shoves a trash bag in my face saying something about how she\u2019ll be super pissed if miranda pukes in her car (valid) and that she\u2019s disappointed. then once we drop miranda off when miranda is getting out of the car she\u2019ll turns to me and says \u201cyou gonna walk her to the door?\u201d like okay petty but whatever. then after talking to other people i found out she was pregaming by smoking weed before the party. i\u2019m just very conflicted. \n"}

{"id": "1mxuny9", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "An estranged friend reached out needing someone to talk to after years of not communicating due to his drug problem. He immediately suggested meeting for drinks and shared videos of drug use. Speaker B hasn't responded yet.\n\nSpeaker B, a 32-year-old man born and raised in NYC, met a friend, a 27-year-old man, at a bar in 2021. At that time, Speaker B was around 28 or 29, and the friend had just moved to NYC the week they met, looking for friends while out solo.\n\nSpeaker B was originally on a date with another guy, which was going horribly. The guy was obnoxiously drunk and drawing attention to them. A couple of times, the friend, referred to as Speaker A, looked over, concerned but almost laughing. Eventually, they ended up talking when both went to the bar for a drink. The guy Speaker B was on a date with ended up getting kicked out, and Speaker B stayed to have drinks with Speaker A.\n\nThey hooked up that night and kept in touch, hanging out regularly and maintaining a friends-with-benefits relationship. Speaker B encouraged Speaker A to explore the city, make new friends, and pursue other guys, taking him under his wing and beginning to see him as a little brother.\n\nAfter about six months in New York, Speaker A started making other friends and going on dates, which Speaker B continued to encourage. They would still hang out, getting drinks and doing regular activities together.\n\nEventually, Speaker B started receiving messages on dating apps and Instagram from people expressing concern for Speaker A, asking how Speaker B knew him after seeing photos of them together. Not long after, Speaker B found out that Speaker A had been hanging out with questionable people and had fallen into serious substance abuse issues. Many of the people messaging Speaker B accused Speaker A of having a severe drug problem, describing him as a complete mess when they hung out, with some claiming he had stolen from them or their friends.\n\nSpeaker B talked to Speaker A about these concerns, but Speaker A became defensive, making excuses and claiming that those people were lying, displaying typical behavior expected from an addict. Speaker B noted that his childhood best friend was also an addict, and having lost her in 2019, he recognized the signs in Speaker A's behavior, which was triggering. Consequently, Speaker B stopped spending as much time with him.\n\nAfter that, the situation continued to deteriorate. Speaker B still heard stories about Speaker A from others, and they spent less time together due to Speaker A's behavior when not sober, which was genuinely frightening for Speaker B. It reached a point where Speaker A had been kicked out and banned from multiple bars.\n\nSpeaker B entered a relationship and went out less, but whenever he saw Speaker A, it was usually because Speaker A had just been fired and needed help finding a job or had just been kicked out of his apartment and needed somewhere to stay. Speaker A was spiraling. He eventually moved back home to the Midwest, and they lost touch entirely after that, which was at the end of 2022.\n\nBetween then and now, they hardly spoke, aside from Speaker A calling Speaker B five times in a row every couple of months at 3 AM, which Speaker B did not answer. Speaker A would then text, flipping out and blowing up Speaker B's phone.\n\nOn one occasion, Speaker A called in the middle of the night, upset about a mutual friend from New York that Speaker B had been spending time with. He accused Speaker B of sleeping with this friend, but his words were incoherent and made little sense. At that point, Speaker B lost his patience, blew up, and they stopped talking altogether.\n\nFast forward to now, and it has been three years without a conversation. Speaker B hasn't heard from Speaker A outside of the occasional 3 AM text, which he does not answer. The only information Speaker B has about Speaker A now comes from social media, where Speaker A has leaned heavily into the \"addict aesthetic.\" Most of his posts depict him smoking or looking unwell and unhinged.\n\nRecently, Speaker A called Speaker B out of the blue while Speaker B was at work. Having just gotten a new phone and lost all his contacts, Speaker B texted to ask who it was. This led to the conversation mentioned earlier. Speaker B hasn't responded to Speaker A's last message yet and plans to eventually but is unsure of what to say.\n\nAt this point in his life, Speaker B has made a conscious decision to remove himself from taxing situations. He is dealing with his own mental health struggles and worries that he does not have the emotional bandwidth to take on someone else's issues, despite wanting to be supportive.\n\nSpeaker B also finds Speaker A's method of reaching out odd. One of the videos Speaker A sent was of him having sex with two other guys while they all smoked meth. Additionally, for someone trying to get sober, it is puzzling that Speaker A would immediately suggest meeting for drinks. While Speaker B understands self-deprecating humor as a coping mechanism, he also recognizes a level of avoidance in Speaker A's behavior, especially given the lack of accountability and the jokes being made.\n\nSpeaker B does not believe Speaker A owes him a grand apology; in fact, he is not even angry with him. However, Speaker B does not want to put himself back in an uncomfortable situation that he has successfully removed himself from, especially when there is little evidence suggesting that things would be different this time.\n\nSpeaker B wants to be a support system for Speaker A and is pleased to see that Speaker A seems to be trying to make the right decisions. However, Speaker B also knows what it was like going through this the first time and feels the need to protect his own peace.", "c1_input": "Speaker A greeted Speaker B, who identified themselves as an old friend and shared that they are now sober and looking to reconnect.

A lot of the people that were messaging me were accusing him of having a severe drug problem, being a complete mess when they hung out and a couple people said that he had stolen things from them or their friends. \n\n(Continued in the comments, mods please pin the comment if you can!)\n\nSo I ended up talking to him about it and he basically got really defensive and was making a bunch of excuses and saying that those people were lying and just like all of the typical things that you would expect when it comes to an addict. It's also something to note that my childhood best friend was also an addict, and I had just previously lost her in 2019 so I was recognizing all the signs and it was triggering to say the least so, I stopped spending as much time with him. \n\nAfter that, it was just more of the same. I was still hearing stories about him from people, and we kind of stopped spending as much time together because of what he was like when he was not sober, it was not fun to be around and genuinely scared me. It had gotten to a point where he had been kicked out and banned from multiple bars.\n\nI ended up getting into a relationship and was not going out as much but every time I saw him, it was kind of because he either had just gotten fired and needed help trying to find a job, or he had just gotten kicked out of his apartment and needed somewhere to stay. But he was just spiraling. He ended up moving back home (in the midwest) and we pretty much lost touch entirely after that (this was the end of 2022, so 3 years ago).\n\nBetween then and now, we're hardly spoke besides him calling me, five times in a row every couple months at 3am, which I wouldn't answer and then he would text me and flip out on me and blow up my phone. \n\n\n\nOne of these times where he called me in the middle of the night flipping out was about a mutual friend of ours that he knew when he was in New York that I had been spending time with. He essentially called me and just accused me of sleeping with him and none of what he was saying was a string of coherent words or would make any sense for him to be upset about even if it was true (H and the guy never dated or hooked up up) So at that point I just lost my patience with him, blew up and we stopped talking altogether after that. \n\nFast forward to now, and it's been three years and we have not had a conversation. I haven't heard from him outside of the odd 3am text every couple of months or so which I don't answer. The only things I know about him now are what I can see on social media, which is that he leaned really hard into the \"addict aesthetic.\" Most of his posts are of him smoking or looking really unwell and unhinged. \n\nNow, all out of the blue, he randomly called me this week when I was at work and I had just gotten a new phone and lost all of my contacts soI texted asking who it was and that was our conversation above. I haven't responded to his last message. I plan to eventually but I can't figure out what to say.\n\nAt this point in my life, I have made the conscious decision to remove myself from situations that are taxing to me. I'm dealing with my own mental health struggles and my own issues and my worry is that I don't have the emotional bandwidth to take on someone else's as much as I want support. \n\nI also find the way that he chose to message me a bit odd. One of the videos that he sent me above was literally him having sex with two other guys while they all smoked meth. Also, for someone that's sober or trying to get sober, to immediately suggest we get drinks when we hang out is kind of a head-scratcher. It's one thing to be self-deprecating, I think that's kind of a coping mechanism a lot of the time but I also think that there is a level of avoidance that comes with that, specifically being that there's still been no accountability taken and we're already making jokes about it. \n\nI'm not saying that he owes me a big grand apology because he doesn't. In fact, I'm not even mad at him. I just don't want to put myself back in an uncomfortable situation that I've successfully removed myself with when there's not a lot of strong evidence pointing to it not happening again.\n\nWhere should I go from here? I definitely want to be a support system for him and I'm really happy that it seems like he is trying to make the right decisions. I just also know what it was like going through it the first time and I really need to protect my peace as well.\n\n**TL;DR: AITO for not calling a friend who reached out to reconnect years later after (kind of) trying to get sober to protect my peace?**"}

I finally got my own car, filled my schedule to the brim, and got a part time job so I wouldn't have to go back home every. Single. Weekend. Now, I graduated and work a pretty decent job where I can afford a 1b1b apartment by myself. My parents pay half the rent, but FOR my sister, otherwise I could absolutely afford the apartment myself. \n\nMy dad texted me this at work and hasn't responded since then. Im just so beyond angry. I know I'm not over reacting, my friends are telling me that too, but I also know my parents are going to guilt me into thinking I am. I mean by the screenshots, you can already tell my dad is. "}

She won't speak to him or even text him. I came out here from the Midwest to help get my Dad settled into a new home. I'm from a large family and though I came out to \"work\" I've tried to see as much family as I can. My mother lives with my younger sister about 45 min from where I've been staying. They were all exposed to hand, foot and mouth disease. Naturally, my siblings who are parents didn't want any exposure themselves so I haven't gotten to see my mother. It was suggested that we see her on our last day at say, a coffee shop, and then she could drive us to the airport to catch our flight. She agreed and she said she'd pick me up tmrw at 9am. Side note, my dad's vision has gotten very bad and we don't think he should be driving anymore. The screenshots tell the rest of the story. Bottom line, I feel like seeing my daughter and I isn't priority for her and I also resent that while she won't even speak to my father she just expects him to do her bidding.

This didn\u2019t bother Speaker B, as they clean up after themselves and know that any mess is probably not Speaker B's (there are four people living there). \n\nAbout a week later, the housemate accused Speaker B of opening someone else\u2019s mail\u2014not her mail, but one of the other girls'.

Speaker B proposed to Speaker A in March 2021, and they had a wedding in November 2022. They are not legally married through the court because Speaker B is still tied to his ex-wife, who is also the mother of his children, due to a lengthy divorce proceeding.\n\nFor the past five years, their relationship has been great, full of respect, honesty, and loyalty to each other. They never cussed each other out or physically harmed each other. Occasional disagreements ended cordially and mutually. They loved each other very deeply and spent all their free time together, with some time apart to spend with friends and family. They became very close and enjoyed their time together. Speaker A was Speaker B's best friend and someone he relied on for support, encouragement, and companionship through hard times, and he was the same for her.\n\nAfter Speaker B's diagnosis last May, Speaker A took off the rest of the school year because she is a teacher. She only had a few weeks left before summer break anyway. Throughout the summer, she held things down for Speaker B until she had to go back to work in August. At that time, Speaker B was able to stand but not walk, and he couldn't feed himself or manage hygiene tasks. They needed someone to come and help out during the day. One of Speaker B's cousins came to help. He stayed with them and did everything: showers, cooking meals, and providing overall emotional support for Speaker B while Speaker A was at work. He did it out of the kindness of his heart and never asked to be paid. Months passed while Speaker B declined in strength in his hands, legs, and back. During that time, Speaker A would do her own things: grocery shopping, paying bills, and cooking dinner. Between August and December, they would bump heads over petty things; it was clear that Speaker A knew they needed the cousin's help but didn't want him there. Speaker B and Speaker A had some unpleasant moments, and in Speaker B's defense, he was frustrated and irritated due to his condition. Sometimes, Speaker A would be very impatient with him, which would upset him. All of this was brewing along with everything else happening in the world. On January 7th, Speaker A had an argument with the cousin about him playing PlayStation all day, not helping, eating her food, and so on. She called him a \"bitch,\" and that was essentially it; she told him to get out of her house and take Speaker B with him because she couldn't take care of him by herself.\n\nAfter being kicked out, Speaker B and Speaker A stayed together. Speaker B and his cousin relocated to Las Vegas (Speaker B lived in California) to his brother's house. While living there, Speaker A never came to visit but took a couple of trips back for reasons other than visiting him. It's important to note that Speaker B uses talking software on an iPad equipped with eye-tracking technology, so he hadn't spoken to her over the phone with a clear voice since the end of 2024. They communicated mostly via text, discussing casual topics and occasionally when Speaker B tried to convince her to let him come home. That is when she started revealing why she was behaving this way. She began telling Speaker B that he was not the same person, that he had changed, and that she felt like she was walking on eggshells. She told him that he reminded her of living with her abusive baby daddy, whom she had been with for eight years. She then told him that he would say mean things that hurt her. Essentially, things between them became degraded, and all of a sudden, he was not the loving man she once knew. They would go back and forth about her being right and him being wrong. Speaker B was falling into depression and embarrassment for being kicked out of their home, being away from his stepdaughters, and the only parts of his body he could control were his neck, eyes, and torso (leaning up and side to side). After all this, and not making love to her for months because her excuse was that there were too many people in the house, including the girls and his cousin, he still loved her. Speaker A would help him with his medical needs, like talking to the doctor's office and providing products he could use, while he helped with the password to the Wi-Fi and other household questions she had. Sometimes they would go days without texting. Sometimes, Speaker B would feel frustrated and leave her alone, but when she went halfway from Southern California's High Desert area to Las Vegas on Valentine's Day, he was crushed because he had been counting on her to show that initiative to him. He wanted her to demonstrate that, yes, they were going through a storm, but love hadn't faded and that she cared for him deeply and wanted to hug and kiss him and watch a movie or something. However, she told him he should have reminded her to come see him in Vegas. \n\nSpeaker B and his cousin then moved back to California to stay at their grandmother's house because she believed she could help him beat ALS with God's help. Speaker B thought that now the distance between him and Speaker A had shortened to 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the day. She did show up a few times when it was convenient for her. Since moving to Moreno Valley on February 20th, Speaker B had seen her four times up until April 1st.\n\nSpeaker A's last visit was on Wednesday, March 26th, which started off wonderfully. She brought him his favorite dish from his favorite Thai restaurant and fed it to him. This is how most of the visits went. They were short because Speaker A and Speaker B's cousin hadn't talked to each other since January 8th, making it cringe-worthy and awkward when they were around each other, which was why Speaker A didn't come to visit at their house up the hill. During the visit, she started showing Speaker B videos on her phone about her and his stepdaughter's trip to Legoland. While watching the video, she received a call from someone listed as \"Will,\" but she didn't answer. Speaker B examined the look on her face. The call came again, and she still didn't answer. Speaker B thought to himself, \"Why not?\" He didn't know everyone she knew, but she always answered phone calls in front of him unless it was a scam or something similar. This is when his suspicion turned into reality, and he dropped his head to show her that he was no longer interested in her video. At that time, he was facing her with his wheelchair turned in her direction because he usually parked in front of his iPad. He typed, \"please leave.\" She responded, \"Before you get all crazy, it's a friend of (her daughter's name) from school.\" It was 1:52 PM on a Wednesday, and since she was a teacher on spring break, Speaker B almost fell for it. He typed, \"call him back.\" She refused and said, \"I'm not going to have this conversation in front of him.\" Speaker B thought to himself, \"In front of who? My cousin or the teenage boy?\" At that moment, he went deep into his feelings and reflected on many events that had happened, the sequence of the whole eviction, and how she could go days without checking on him, wondering who had been gassing her up (especially considering the way she would come at his cousin and his mom, calling them names). The next thing he typed was, \"I hate you... Forever.\" She read it and didn't react at all. He had never talked to her that way, and she didn't cry or slap him. She said, \"I know you do; you've been talking to me that way for months.\" Speaker B thought to himself, \"Right, that is what I do\u2014disrespect the love of my life.\" She left after trying to kiss his head and telling him it was nothing and that she loved him. \n\nSpeaker B FaceTimed her as she was getting in her car. She answered and said, \"What do you want? I told you the truth. I'm not doing this with you. I'm driving!\" He kept asking her over and over again, but she wouldn't relent. This back-and-forth continued throughout the rest of the day, leading to their usual discussions about why he was mean to her and how he was going to give her a nervous breakdown.\n\nThe reason Speaker B left it alone that day was that he told her he would ask her daughter, and she said to go ahead. He told her he had already asked (which was a lie), and she responded that if their daughter confirmed her story, that would be that. He didn't want to involve the kids, so he didn't ask her. Plus, their daughter had her own phone, and no one called her mom's phone for her. Speaker B left it alone all day Thursday and Friday. They talked normally, and he pretended she wasn't lying. On Friday, she and the girls spontaneously drove to Arizona to visit her brother for his wife's birthday. They went to dinner as a family, but afterward, the adults went to the casino. Speaker B decided to ask her daughter anyway. He texted her, \"Who is Will?\" Minutes later, Speaker A texted back, \"Why are you texting her? She doesn't know what you're talking about.\" This confirmed Speaker B's suspicions. He left it alone and went to bed. On Saturday morning, he woke up determined to get his answer. He logged into the Verizon account and checked the usage details", "c1_input": "Speaker A expressed deep affection for Speaker B, emphasizing their commitment and innocence regarding a past friend. Speaker B, feeling insecure and confused, shared their struggles with love and honesty, questioning Speaker A's truthfulness about the friendship. The conversation revealed tension around trust and communication, with Speaker A attempting to protect Speaker B's feelings while Speaker B sought clarity and honesty.", "c2_input": "Speaker A: I get it\nSpeaker B: Yes say what is need to say\nSpeaker B: In the past I would have replaced this relationship but I can't do that, this sick feeling only went away that way.

I  proposed  to  her  in  March  2021  and  we  had  a  wedding  in  November  2022.  We  aren't  married  through  the  court  because  I'm  still legally tied to my ex wife who is also my kid's mother and a lengthy divorce proceeding. \n\nThat being said, for the past 5 years our relationship has been great . Full of respect, honesty and being loyal to each other. We never cussed each other out or physically harmed each other. Occasional disagreements ended cordially and mutual. We loved each other very deeply, we spent all our free time with each other (with some time apart to spend time with friends and family of our own) . We became very close and enjoyed our time together. She was my best friend and someone I relied on to support, encourage and accompany me through hard times and I was the same to her.\n\nSo,  after  diagnosis  last   May she  took  off  the  rest  of  the  school  year  because  she  is  a  teacher.  She  only  had  a  few  weeks  left  before  summer  break  anyway.  So,  through  out  the  summer  she  was  holding  things  down  for  me,  up  until  she  had  to  go  back  to  work  in  August.  At  that  time  I  was  able  to  stand  but  not  walking,  and  I  couldn't  feed  myself  or  do  hygiene  stuff,  anyway  we  needed  someone  to  come  and  help  out  during  the  day.  God  sent  one  of  my  cousins  to  help.  He  stayed  with  us  and  did  everything,  showers,  cooking  meals  and  being  an  overall  emotional  support for me while she was at work. He  does  it  out  of  the  kindness  of  his  heart  and  never  ask  to  get  paid.  Months  past  while  declining  in  strength  in  hands,  legs  and  my  back.  During  that  time she  would  do  her  thing,  groceries  shopping,  paying  bills  and cooking  dinner.  Ok, between August and December they would bump heads over petty things, you can tell she knew we needed him but she didn't want him there. Her and I had some unpleasant moments and in my defense i was frustrated and irritated due to my condition and to be real sometimes she would very inpatient with me which would piss me off. So all this is brewing up with all the rest of the stuff going in the world. On January 7th she an argument with him about him playing Playstation all day and not helping, eating her food and blah blah blah, she called him a bitch and pretty much that was it. she told him to get out her house and take me  with him because she can't take care of me  by herself.\n\nOkay,   now   for   the   twist.   After   being   kicked   out   spouse   and   I   stayed   together.   My   cousin   and   I   relocated   to   las   Vegas   ( I   lived   in   California)   to   his   brother's   house.   While   living   there   she   never   came   to   visit   but   took   a   couple   of   trips   back   for   other   reasons   than   just   to   her.   It's   important   to   know   I   use   a   talking   software   on   an   iPad   equipped   with   eye   tracking   technology   so   I   haven't   talked   to   her   over   the   phone   with   a   clear   voice   since   the   end   of   2024.   So,   we   would   talk   via   text   mostly   casual   topics   and   occasional   when   I   tried   to   convince   her   to   let   me   come   home.   That   is   when   she   started   revealing   why   she   is   being   this   way.   She   starts   telling   me   I'm   not   the   same   person,   I've   changed   and   she   felt   like   she   was   walking   on   eggshells.   She   told   me   I   was   remainder   her   living   with   her   abusive   baby   daddy   she   was   with   for   8   years.   Okay,   then   she   tells   me   I   would   say   mean   things   that   hurt   her.   Basically,   things   between   us   became   degraded   and   all   of   a   sudden   I'm   not   the   loving   man   she   knew.   So,   we   would   go   back   and   forth   about   her   being   right   and   me   being   wrong.   I   was   falling   into   a   depression   and   embarrassment   for   being   kicked   out   our   home,   being   away   from   my   step   daughters   and   only   thing   on   my   body   I   can   control   is   my   neck,   eyes   and   torso   (leaning   up   and   side   to   side).   After   all   this,   and   not   making   love   to   her   for   months   because   her   excuse   was   too   people   in   the   house,   what   about   the   girls   and   your   cousin,   I   still   was   in   love   with   her.   She   would   help   me   out   with   my   medical   needs   like   talking   to   the   doctor's   office,   providing   products   I   could   use   and   I   helped   with   the   password   to   the   Wi-Fi   and   other   ground   keeping   questions   she   had   around   the   house.   Sometimes   we   days   without   texting.   Sometimes   I   was   like   fuc*   it   and   left   her   alone   but   when   she   went   half   way   from   Southern   California ,   High   Desert   area,   to   Las   Vegas   which   is   like   Baker,   on   valentine's   day   I   was   crushed   because   I   was   counting   her   to   show   that initiative to me yes we're going through a storm but love hasn't and she cares for deeply and that she wants me, to hug and kiss me and watch a movie or something. But she told me I should have reminded her to come see me in Vegas. Alright, say less because the family week my cousin and I moved back to California to stay our granny's house because she believes she can help me beat ALS with help from God. So, my thinking was now my spouse distance between me and her shorten to 45 to an hour depending on the day. She did show up a few times when it was convenient for her. I've been in Moreno Valley since February 20th and I seen her four times up until now April 1st. \n\nSo,  her  last  visit  was  last  Wednesday  26th,  which  started  off  wonderful.  She  bought  me  my  favorite  dish  from  my  favorite  Thai  restaurant,  feed  it  to  me,  cool.  This  is  how  must  of  the  visit  were.  They  are  short  to  because  her  and  my  cousin  hasn't  talked  to  each  other  since  January  8th,  so  it's  cringe  and  awkward  when  their  around  each  other  and  that  is  the  reason  why  I  don't  come  to  visit  at  our  house  up  the  hill.  Anyway,  she  started  showing  me  videos  on  her  phone  about  her  and  my  step  daughter's  trip  to  Legoland.  I'm  watching  the  video  and  she  gets  a  call  from  a  name  listed  as  Will,  she  didn't  answer.  I  examined  the  look  on  her  face.  They  call again   and  didn't  answer.  Now  I'm  like  dang  why  not.  I  don't  everyone  she  knows  but  she  always  answered  phone  call  in  front  of  me  unless  was  a  scam  likely  or  whatever.  This  is  where  my  suspicion  meet  reality  and  I  drop  my  head  show  her  that  I'm  no  longer  interested  in  your  video.  At  the  time  I  was  facing  her  with  my  wheelchair  turned  her  direction  because  usually  parked  in  front  of  my  iPad.  I  told  I  asked  my  cousin  to  turn  me  in  front  of  my  iPad.  I  typed \"please  leave\".  She  said\"before  you  get  all  crazy,  it's  a  friend  of  (her  daughter's  name)  from  school.  Okay,  it's  1:  52p  on  a  Wednesday  (she  is  a  teacher  and  was  on  spring  break,  so  I  almost  fell  for  it).  I  typed\"call  him  back\".  She refused and said\"I'm not going to have this conversation in front of him\". In front of who I thought to myself, my cousin or the teenage boy? At the moment I went deep into my feelings and thought about a lot of events that happened, the sequence of the whole eviction and how she can go days without checking on me and wondering who has been gassing her (especially the way she would come at my cousin and his mom, like calling them out their name). Next thing I do is type\"I hate you. . . Forever\". She read it and didn't react at all. I never talked to her that way, and she didn't cry or slap me. She said I know you do, you been talking to me that way for months\". I'm like\"right that is what I do, disrespect the love of my life. \"in my head. So, she leaves, after trying to kiss my head and tell me it's nothing and that she loves me. Alright, she loves me? Let us see. I FaceTime her as she was getting in her car. She answered, and goes\"what do you want? I told you the truth. I'm not doing this with you. I'm driving! \". I'm asking her over and over again. She not letting up. Double downs. Triple down. This went on the rest of the day which lead to our usual talks about why I'm mean to her and going to give her a nervous breakdown.\n\n \nThe   reason   why   I   left   it   alone   that   day   is   because   I   told   her   I   will   ask   her   daughter   and   she   go   ahead.   I   told   her   I   did   already   (which   is   a   lie)   and   she   well   as   if   our   daughter   confirmed   her   story.   I   didn't   want   to   involve   the   kids   so   I   didn't   ask   her.   Plus   our   daughter   has   her   own   phone,   no   one   calls   her   mom's   phone   for   her. I left it alone all day Thursday and Friday. We talked normal and I pretended she wasn't a liar. Friday she and the girls went drove to Arizona, spontaneous action she called it. Her bother lives out there and it was his wife birthday. They went to dinner all as a family but afterwards the adults went to the casino. I decided to ask her daughter anyway. I texted her\"who is will? Minutes later my spouse text\"why are you texting her, she doesn't know what your talking about\". Alright, boom! Lies! Left alone and went to bed. Saturday morning I got up determined to get my answer. I logged into the Verizon account and went to the usage details for her number and back to Wednesday around the time of the call. Ah! Found the number, but it wasn't a California number but a 605 area code. This number was everywhere on list. Morning , noon and night. Here is the screenshot of confession https://i.postimg.cc/kXDmg9bF/IMG-0182.jpg And I also went back in call history and found the number began showing up in August. \n\n"}

The breakup was due to several reasons, but the biggest was that he had begun acting really strange not long into the relationship. He would randomly act very distant or angry, and then say he was just acting a little bit after the fact. Speaker B had asked him several times not to do this; after he disclosed he had mental health issues, Speaker B was concerned about not being able to know when he was actually feeling depressed. Later on, when he, his friend Logan (fake name, green censor), and Speaker B were at the pool, Speaker B told them she had a really bad fear of water and that she couldn't swim. Then, about half an hour later, when her back was turned, Alex jumped at her and held her underwater. Speaker B freaked out and had a panic attack; he tried to console her afterward but gave up and got moody when she wasn't immediately back to normal. After this incident, a little more time passed before Speaker B gave him a little splash to catch his attention, and he straight up grabbed her by the throat. It wasn't hard at all and didn't leave a mark, but it was alarming. All of this summed up to Speaker B eventually breaking up with him, along with some minor reasons that rubbed her the wrong way, such as him using himself as a reaction image frequently and unironically.\n\nHowever, the screenshots are of a conversation Speaker B had with someone she went on a date with. This person was friends with Alex before Speaker B had known him, and Speaker B knew about her somewhat from school and somewhat from how often Alex spoke about her.

The date went super well, and they had an awesome time, with plans to go out again before she sent the texts in the screenshots.\n\nAs the date described it, her parents forced her to unblock Alex and Logan and \"fact check\" Speaker B about the things he did.

When he went to send a picture to the group chat, she had seen a picture of a girl in her bra in his camera roll. When she saw this, she immediately looked at him, and his face looked stressed.

Yet, all of them, besides Speaker B's mom (who didn't vote), voted for Trump.\n\nFor those unaware, RFK Jr. spoke about starting a \"camp\" for autistic children, and Trump announced he would elect RFK Jr. as the head of the Department of Education, all well before the election, so it shouldn't have come as a surprise to anyone.\n\nSpeaker B and Speaker B's mom talked about all of this before, and that is what this conversation is referring to. Speaker B's mom also agreed that this was a horrible thing on the part of Trump and RFK Jr., and that there's no excuse for their family voting for it, even if they didn't have a family member with autism.\n\nSpeaker B's first issue was Speaker B's mom's idea to just not talk about it.

They began dating in August 2023 after meeting in May of the same year. Speaker B has expressed curiosity about how Speaker A interacts with her bar regulars and has given her multiple chances to be honest about it. However, Speaker A insisted that her interactions were straightforward and not flirty. \n\nSpeaker B discovered that Speaker A had not been truthful when helping her set up a new Apple Watch. An alarming message appeared, and when Speaker B tapped on the conversation in front of Speaker A, she claimed it never crossed her mind to mention it because the flirtation she receives at work has become so normalized that it goes in one ear and out the other. This revelation further damaged the trust in their relationship. \n\nSpeaker B then inquired about another regular who had offered Speaker A a secretary job at his office, expressing discomfort about the situation. Speaker A described him as normal, married, and with a baby. When Speaker B asked to check their direct messages, they found multiple instances of the regular calling Speaker A \u201cbabe\u201d and \u201csmoking hot.\u201d Speaker A claimed she had forgotten he spoke to her that way and explained that she fakes maintaining these relationships for financial gain. This regular brings his wife and baby into the restaurant where Speaker A works, which made Speaker B feel sickened. \n\nThe trust was further eroded that same night. While visiting Speaker A during her shift, Speaker B encountered her iCloud-synced iPad and felt compelled to look through it. Although Speaker B regretted the action, they felt justified when they discovered a screenshot of Speaker A badmouthing Speaker B to a long-time friend after Speaker B forgot to post about her birthday. Speaker B had been busy with midterms and work and is generally not active on social media. This was not the first instance of Speaker A speaking negatively about Speaker B; she had previously yelled at him, calling him derogatory names, and had even begged him to break up with her while she was intoxicated.\n\nSpeaker B confronted Speaker A about her comments to her friend, but her immediate response was to tell him to pack his things and leave. This reaction left Speaker B flabbergasted, as Speaker A refused to discuss the matter.

She\u2019s a twin peaks bartender. We\u2019ve had several talks about my curiosity about how she carries herself at work with her bar regulars. Gave her multiple chances to be honest but she said it was nothing at all she is straight to the point and not flirty. Found out this was a lie by helping her pair a new Apple Watch and seeing an alarming message and tapping on the conversation in front of her. It\u2019s one of the attachments. Tells me it never crossed her mind to tell me because \u201call this flirtation she receives at work has become such a norm that it goes in one ear and out the other\u201d. Trust dented. Start asking her about another regular I had a bad feeling about that offered her a secretary job at his office. She said he was normal, married with a baby. I say okay and ask to check their dms together. Multiple instances of him swiping up on a story calling her a \u201cbabe\u201d and \u201csmoking\u201d \u201chot\u201d etc. said she forgot he spoke to her that way. Giving her benefit of the doubt because she never returned the energy to this guy. Says her logic is that she fakes maintaining these relationships for financial gain. He brings his wife and baby in to the restaurant and she serves all 3 sometimes. Sickening. But still, trust takes another dent same night. Rocky week after that. I visit while she\u2019s still working a shift because we are in fact long distance. And there it is. Her iCloud synced iPad. I had to. I regret the act of doing it but felt justified once I found the other screenshot. It\u2019s her badmouthing me to her long time friend after I forgot to post her on her birthday. I was very busy with midterms and work and I\u2019m also just not even present on social media myself. Not the first time she\u2019s spoken like this. She\u2019s called me effing ret***** to my face yelling. She\u2019s begged me to break up with her while she was blacked out and I was sober because I had to end my bday night out to take her home bc she over drank. That night she got triggered by me being upset that she didn\u2019t consider it was my bday. Anyway, this combines with a bunch of moments of lashing out with a nasty tone kind of abruptly over things that shouldn\u2019t be lashed out over. I confronted her about her talking about me to her friend this way. Her immediate response before I can even finish is \u201cI\u2019m done pack your things and leave\u201d. I\u2019m flabbergasted at this point. She won\u2019t even give me a discussion about it. Her reason was because she \u201cis tired of always hurting me\u201d and \u201calways being the bad guy\u201d which is also her first response whenever I do have an issue with how she acts. I\u2019m a fool for always letting her flip the script. Don\u2019t hate me but I\u2019m also a fool for begging her to reconsider.she Doubled down several times before finally taking it back and talking to me about it. Looking back I ask myself where the heck my dignity went but i gotta be honest I\u2019m blinded by love and wanted to give it more chances. Since this she has profusely apologized for everything and said she will work on being more open and her tone. And \u201cadmitted\u201d that if I actually packed my things that day she would\u2019ve called me back over to work on it shortly after. Anyway. I still feel guilty I\u2019ve never looked through anyone\u2019s private messages. But. I\u2019ve also never been made to feel like I had to until now. AIO for looking? And am I underreacting to the bigger picture here?\nSide note: according to her , the kiss on the cheek her regular mentions was her kissing her hand and tapping his cheek\n(Sorry this still ended up becoming an essay.)"}

Speaker B and Speaker A have never had a good relationship. Speaker B feels like the epitome of an abused dog; the meaner Speaker A was and the more Speaker A abused Speaker B, the harder Speaker B would work to make Speaker A happy and/or proud. Speaker B was a competition dancer until Speaker B's early 20s, traveling and competing extensively. Speaker B has been on Speaker B's own since the age of 15. There are many more details, but for the purpose of this post, Speaker B did not want it to be any longer than it already is.\n\nSix months ago, Speaker B was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Before Speaker B had the chance to begin processing this, Speaker B's entire family disappeared, providing no help or support. Speaker B is prescribed a very expensive medication that, even after insurance and assistance programs, leaves Speaker B responsible for $1,968 per month. Speaker B has never been able to afford it and likely never will. Speaker B previously sought help online to prevent this situation but was scammed and told that if Speaker B wanted money, Speaker B would have to do things that were difficult for Speaker B but did anyway (content) and then was never sent the money. Others reached out, claiming they would send money for Speaker B's medication, but they either laughed at Speaker B when Speaker B replied or did not respond at all. They came to Speaker B. This situation has landed Speaker B in the hospital, where Speaker B will remain until able to afford the medication to take at home.\n\nAs a single mom, Speaker B's children are at risk of ending up in foster care. A neighbor has graciously offered to keep Speaker B's boys if Speaker B can cover the groceries (around $150) for them.

I'm the epitomy of an abused dog. The meaner she was and more she abused me, the harder I would work to make her happy and/or proud of me. I was a competition dancer until my early 20's. I traveled, competed, the whole nine. I've been on my own since I was 15 years old. There is A LOT more details be for the purpose of this post, I didn't want it any longer than it already is!\n\n6 months ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness. And before I even had the chance to begin to process this, my entire family disappeared. No help, nothing. I'm prescribed a very expensive medication that even after insurance and assistance programs, I'm still responsible for $1,968 per month. I've never been able to afford it. I will likely never be able to afford it. I came on here a while ago looking for help to prevent this but all I got was scammed and told if I wanted money Id have to do things I couldnt really do but did anyway (content) and then was never sent the money. Also had people reach out saying they would send me money for my medication then laughed at me when I replied or didnt answer my reply at all. They came to me. \nIt has landed me in the hospital where I will continue to be until I'm able to afford the medication to take at home. \n\nBeing a single Mom, my children are going to end up in foster care. \nMy neighbor has graciously offered to keep my boys if I were able to cover the groceries ($150 or so) for them. She is elderly and on a fixed income. \n\nLast night I reached out to my Mom against my better judgment and the screen shots are how it unfolded. So....AIO by being upset??"}

A has had pretty extreme selective mutism his entire life and as far as I know he only talks to his family and me.\nBoth boyfriend and O know of his sm. She didn't say anything when he was being rude to A about it, so I spoke up and told him to shut it. I definitely could have been nicer about how I told him off I admit that as I was pretty snappy about it.\nHe stopped for a little but then started up the rude comments again, so I made an excuse for me and A to go home.\n\nAfter that, O texts me (the first screenshot) and I immediately screenshotted the conversation and sent it to a group chat without her in it, since she's apart of the group and I wanted people to know what shit she was pulling with A. Everyone was pissed with O, and K (one of A and O's good mates) said she'd talk with O.\n\nScreenshot 2 is after K had lunch with O. They apparently got into some argument that I didn't get the full details on, but long story short K is not talking to O, and has told the group that they should probably steer clear of O.\n\nNow here's my question, did I overreact by telling the whole group? A is telling me it wasn't that big of a deal and that he's used to situations like this happening, but I really don't want to accept that. I know he was uncomfortable that whole night, and I personally think O and her boyfriend should be held accountable for their behaviour. However, one of my mates also told me I overreacted, so AIO?"}

They denied all knowledge and apparently didn't keep anything at their apartment. The police thought they found the speakers, but it turned out to be a different set. The thief never returned his key, so Speaker B paid for a locksmith who changed the locks.\n\nSpeaker B received a call yesterday from a blocked number. Speaker B didn't recognize her voice, and she refused to say who she was. She said Speaker B could get Speaker B's stuff back as long as Speaker B promised not to press charges. The only thing was, the knives were apparently already sold. She offered Speaker B the money they made, but it was less than half its retail value.\n\nSpeaker B talked to Speaker B's dad, who is a lawyer in another country. They felt the most important thing was to get the hard drive back. When the girl called Speaker B back, Speaker B told her they agreed. Three hours later, the speakers, hard drive, and some (but not all) of Speaker B's missing jewelry were outside Speaker B's door in a cardboard box, along with $150.\n\nSpeaker B thought a lot about it and decided to file a restraining order against the thief. This whole ordeal has been so terrifying. Speaker B has never been gaslit like this and honestly feels afraid of this person Speaker B used to genuinely like.\n\nSpeaker B's family told Speaker B to go ahead with pressing charges anyway. The police officer heading the case is of the opinion that people like this will reoffend unless something changes in their lives. Thanks to everyone's overwhelming support, Speaker B thinks they will go ahead with it.\n\nSpeaker B's dad said there is more than enough evidence to pursue a case against them. He said the damages exceed what was actually stolen from Speaker B, and Speaker B is now in touch with one of his associates. The maximum penalty would be up to 6 months in jail and a fine of $5,000.\n\nMany people told Speaker B they were being too nice to the thief, but Speaker B still feels conflicted. On one hand, he was once Speaker B's friend, and Speaker B knows he's going through hard times.

They denied all knowledge and apparently didn't keep anything at their apartment. The police thought they found the speakers but it turned out to be a different set. The thief never returned his key so I paid for a locksmith who changed the locks.\n\nI got a call yesterday from a blocked number. I didn't recognize her voice and she refused to say who she was. She said I can get my stuff back as long as I promised not to press charges. Only thing was, the knives were apparently already sold. She offered me the money they made, but it was was less than half its retail value\u2026\n\nI talked to my dad who's a lawyer in another country. \nWe felt the most important thing was to get the hard drive back. When the girl called me back, I told her I agreed. Three hours later, the speakers and hard drive, and some (but not all) of my missing jewelry was outside my door in a cardboard box, along with $150.\n\nI thought a lot about it and decided to file a restraining order against the thief. This whole ordeal has been so terrifying. I have never been gaslit like this and I honestly feel afraid of this person I used to genuinely like. \n\nMy family told me I should go ahead with pressing charges anyway. The police officer heading the case is of the opinion that people like this will reoffend unless something changes in their lives. And thanks to everyone's overwhelming support here, I think I will go ahead with it.\n\nMy dad said there is more than enough evidence to pursue a case against them. He said the damages exceed what was actually stolen from me and I am now in touch with one of his associates. The maximum penalty would be up to 6 months in jail and a fine of $5,000.\n\nI know so many of you told me I was being too nice to the thief, but I still feel conflicted. On the one hand, he WAS once my friend and I know he's going through hard times. He set to finish his studies this month and had lined up a job interview with the municipal government. He would actually be qualified for the role and I think getting a criminal record would ruin his chance. \n\nBut at the same time, if this person was willing to steal from someone trying to help him and then be so brazenly unapologetic about it, then I don't think he deserves a cushy city job.\n\nSo I am going to follow through with taking legal action. I really don't think I would have had the courage to do it without all the wonderful support online. At this point I don't even care about the stuff - I just want to see justice be done.\n\nPS: I got this text message from the thief literally as I was writing this."}

They wanted to do something nice, taking advantage of the fact that her friend's mom would be working the night shift, allowing them to have the house to themselves. During the party, her friend's brother, who is 21, assaulted Speaker B. After the incident, Speaker B immediately sought comfort from her best friend, expecting her to protect and support her. However, when Speaker B told her friend what had happened, she felt completely brushed off. Despite Speaker B's pleas for her friend to listen, her friend refused to engage. Frustrated, Speaker B ran out of the house without even putting on her shoes.\n\nSpeaker B does not recall how she got home, but she did make it back. Now, she feels deeply hurt and alone in this situation. She loved both her best friend and her brother like family and never imagined they could cause her such pain. This experience has led Speaker B to second-guess herself, wondering if she is overreacting or being unfair to her friend.

As the title states, these are some texts from Speaker B's mom while Speaker B was away. They talked on the phone as well, and Speaker B mentioned giving her a different food, which Speaker B's mom said ended up working. There are no other pictures, and when Speaker B's mom returned, the dog seemed happy but had its tail between its legs. Speaker B assumed the dog was upset about being away for a bit. Speaker B's mom told Speaker B that she spent her days chasing but not catching her chickens, having a great time, and also mentioned that she lost the dog for 45 minutes, which led to the entire neighborhood searching for it, but then the dog just appeared out of nowhere.\n\nNow, it has been a couple of days since they have had the dog back, and it is still holding its tail down and sitting on it. Speaker B got some videos of the dog, and things just seem wrong. \n\nSpeaker B and Speaker B's mom had a falling out a couple of years ago, but they restarted their relationship within the last year. There are many reasons for this, but the most relevant here is that Speaker B took her childhood dog from Speaker B's mom after discovering he had issues that she wasn\u2019t addressing. Speaker B took him without warning; he ended up having cancer, and Speaker B gave him the best last six months she could and let him go in his favorite spot in the yard. A couple of months later, Speaker B said goodbye to her childhood cat and true love, who had battled heart disease for almost two years. For about a year, all Speaker B had left was another cat, who also had cancer.

He recently took her on her first vacation since starting college four years ago. Speaker B trusted his dog to her mom.

Speaker B texted her brother, who is no contact with their mom, and he advised her to get the dog checked before confronting their mom. Speaker B is ready to cut her off for good if the dog is injured. Her boyfriend suggested that maybe the dog just played too hard, but he still wants to know what happened and why they weren\u2019t informed.

Speaker B feels that Speaker A is doing his best to contribute to the bills, so she never faults him for what he can provide.\n\nRecently, Speaker A has been discussing his feelings about his job, mentioning that he has no motivation to go because he hates it.

Speaker B has never made him feel bad about it but has supported him every time and encouraged him to find a new job.\n\nToday, Speaker A texted Speaker B about his ongoing issues with coworkers at work, noting that he has left work early or gone in late over the past couple of days. Speaker B tried to acknowledge his feelings while also reminding him that they still have bills to pay, but he did not take it well. \n\nHe sent her a long message stating that she gave him a \u201cmom response\u201d and that she should have asked how he was feeling instead of telling him to stick it out.

Speaker B, who is 20 years old, has a dad who is 43 and a grandma who is 65.\n\nSpeaker B's hair has always been an issue. It started at camp when Speaker B was around 13 or 14, the summer before 8th grade, when Speaker B got it cut. Speaker B had always wanted short hair since childhood because of experiences with family and an alcoholic uncle who used to live with Speaker B and Speaker A when Speaker B was 3 to 6 years old and abused Speaker A. After being bullied and tormented in middle school, where bullies used Speaker B's hair to hold Speaker B down, it became clear that Speaker B wanted the hair gone. Speaker B went for it and cut it at camp, which was an event where they went to a salon day and parents had signed off on it. They even told Speaker B that they called Speaker A and lied, saying it was okay when Speaker B started getting anxious about it. Long story short, Speaker A and Speaker B's grandma lost it, harassing the camp so badly that Speaker B got banned. Speaker B cried, trying to hide it from Speaker A during the entire 5-hour plane ride home. When Speaker B's dad saw the haircut the next day, he lost it, shouting and hitting things. He yelled at them and then told Speaker B privately, \u201cYou need extensions or something,\u201d and \u201cCongratulations, you\u2019ve made yourself look even bigger now,\u201d and \u201cI could say look for the girl with long hair before, but now I\u2019ll have to say look for the fat kid\u201d if he ever lost Speaker B. He said that since Speaker B was 10, they had made Speaker B keep the hair long to hide Speaker B. Speaker B didn\u2019t cut it again until prom. At that time, Speaker B was 18 and Speaker B's dad was around 40. Speaker B texted him beforehand, saying not to freak out because it was short, thinking a heads-up would help avoid a negative reaction. However, Speaker B's dad messaged back angrily while Speaker B was getting shoes inside and rushed over to find them. When Speaker B turned around to grab something on the staircase, he lost it, screaming, \u201cWhat the f! Why would you let her!\u201d to Speaker A, before slamming the door and running out to the garage, where they heard things shattering, including his artwork and RV cars he works on. He wouldn\u2019t look at Speaker B that night and refused to see Speaker B, not even at graduation about a month later. \n\nToday, after he was in the same room but not paying attention when Speaker B made the hair appointment, he was mad again. This is the conversation they had while Speaker B was at the salon. After Speaker B got home, he just said, \u201cWhat the f\u201d and \u201cNoo!\u201d repeating it as he went to his room in Speaker B's grandma's house. Speaker B's boyfriend, who now lives with them since 2023, tried to help by saying, \u201cShe looks good!\u201d after Speaker B's dad left. Speaker B then went downstairs to ask him what he thought of the new color, but he wouldn\u2019t look at Speaker B, saying, \u201cYou know it\u2019s not about the color,\u201d in a dismissive tone. Speaker B's grandma and Speaker A's only reaction was a text saying \u201cok\u201d to the photo, which seemed angry to Speaker B. \n\nIn summary, Speaker B's family has been obsessed with Speaker B's hair for a long time.

Moisture can be introduced by putting the product into a damp hand, by touching the product with wet hands, or by placing the product in a humid environment.

All of our raw materials and finished goods are tested for the presence of molds before release to ensure there are no fungal or yeast spores present.

I asked why, he said because he didn\u2019t want to be in the relationship. I asked him why he would wait a month and tell me about how happy, stress free, and supported I made him. He didn\u2019t answer. He said that he was testing me to see how I would act today if he \u201cproduced a pattern of behavior that caused issues before\u201d. He\u2019s referring to me being at his house and him demanding that I leave. Hence why after these questions, I left promptly. According to him I failed the test, and his desired correct answer would have been if I approached him about how his actions made me feel uncomfortable (in the messages I literally do exactly that).\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I know going to argue with him at his house was wrong. However, I did that knowing it was, for last straw was done during our text conversation, reading the way he was talking to me.\n\nBut tell me, am I overreacting?"}

We carried her for the first couple of days with a plan to go see the vet, but it was pretty clear that there was probably not going to be a good resolution. When we got there, they told us that it was most likely permanent, there were some drugs that we could try, but no guarantee. I didn\u2019t want her to be in pain anymore, she loved to explore and my mom couldn\u2019t make the decision, she loved Penny so I had to make the call.\n\nI signed the paperwork and it still to this day feels like I killed my dogs, my mom a step dads best friend, even though I know it was to end her suffering. I regret it emotionally but understand it logically.\n\nI opened up to a friend hours and days into the grieving process. I was a mess. I knew I couldn\u2019t open up to my mom because she felt bad enough, if I was going to take this responsibility on myself of being the one that made the decision, I couldn\u2019t burden her with it then as well. So I just talked to this friend. I told her how I was feeling and after I said that I felt like I killed my dog, signed her death warrant she went off on me.

Despite the circumstances, Speaker B believed that the people they worked with were friends and teammates, so they dedicated themselves to helping the business through what they thought would be a temporary setback. During this time, Speaker B was receiving roughly 50% of what they were owed. Speaker B used all their savings and increased their debt by an additional $1,000 before deciding that enough was enough after four months of this arrangement. At that point, Speaker B was owed $4,500. They took $700 worth of saddles and other items (which had been fully discussed) and were left with $3,800 still owed.\n\nThere were discussions about Speaker B taking their boss's mother's horse float instead of the $3,800. Speaker B estimated the float was worth at most $3,000, and they negotiated a couple of times, but nothing was fully settled. It was noted that the boss frequently used his mother's and grandfather's money to fund his mistakes, with the intention of paying his mother back later.\n\nSpeaker B had to move houses twice, having been living with their boss, but since he wasn\u2019t paying rent, they were all given notice to vacate, and the place was demolished for development. Speaker B borrowed the boss's mother's float to assist with the move and had it for a couple of weeks before realizing it wasn\u2019t registered. In Australia, it is possible to register a trailer without it being signed over if it is currently unregistered and the old owner's details are known, which Speaker B had. Therefore, the float is now registered in Speaker B's name and has been for three months.\n\nSpeaker B contacted several individuals regarding the legality of the situation and was advised, including by a police officer, that if the boss wanted to pursue it, it would be a civil matter, not a criminal one, meaning it was not considered stolen.\n\nAfter Speaker B stopped working for them, the people they had supported dropped them as if they were nothing, and Speaker B had not heard from any of them for well over a month. Suddenly, Speaker B received a message asking for the float back. They were incredulous. Speaker B's loyalty to these individuals had cost them all their savings, some of their animals, increased their debt, and jeopardized their future in racing as a trainer. Speaker B had defended these people staunchly for months.\n\nIn summary, Speaker B took property when leaving the company as they were owed $3,800 and registered it in their name.

It\u2019s obvious that the site leans heavily to the left, but that\u2019s not the main topic; what matters is that they have soft spots for those left-wing users, giving them more privilege with what they can post compared to right-wing users. This creates unfair double standards. The left can post comments telling someone to die or spread false information about a person being a pedophile without proving anything, solely because he was supporting Trump. Speaker B wishes they could show all the evidence they have, but they only had so much time before being banned for a month.\n\nSpeaker B tries to call out this hypocrisy or question the moderators' censorship, but every time they do, they get silenced or ridiculed, being put down by claims that they are being dramatic. Speaker B feels that the basic principle for every social media platform is free speech, no matter who it is. Sure, there are rules, but the issue is that each comment deleted is based on the moderators' choice of feelings. They rarely provide legitimate reasons; it\u2019s never about actual violations of the guidelines.

Speaker B pointed out the moderators' incompetence, and when they attempted to report someone using the same tactic, it was frowned upon, proving their point. Yet, no one batted an eye at the moderators. On another occasion, another moderator, Flame, censored a bunch of Speaker B's comments centered around positive, hopeful pictures. Flame sent Speaker B a direct message regarding one of the comments, which was a picture of two people hugging, warning that the image violated the rules and was considered \u201cabusive\u201d or \u201cinappropriate.\u201d The way Flame communicated this was obviously just a copy-paste response; he didn\u2019t care at all. Speaker B posted a screenshot on their blog to expose the situation, but then Flame claimed Speaker B wasn\u2019t allowed to do that\u2014implying they weren\u2019t even permitted to call out the moderators' actions publicly.\n\nWhat really pushed Speaker B over the edge was when they asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that fascist to censor someone\u2019s speech just for calling out the people in power?\u201d in an attempt to make Flame see how much the rules are bent and how inconsistently they are applied. Immediately after, Speaker B was banned for a month, further proving their point with the fascist comment. Flame deleted the blog post without providing any evidence. The last thing Flame threw at Speaker B was, \u201cHope you get better soon,\u201d as if all of this mess was somehow Speaker B's fault, as if they were responsible for the moderators' censorship and bias. That felt like a significant insult to Speaker B.\n\nIt\u2019s infuriating for Speaker B. The moderators silence dissent, hide behind their rules, and then act like victims when called out. Speaker B just needed fairness, but they were shut down. The reason no one else says anything is that they all receive privileges from the moderators, all sharing a liberal mindset. This isn\u2019t political; Speaker B is simply stating that if someone has the same opinions as the moderators, putting down others who don\u2019t will earn them brownie points and better treatment, even if it means spreading false information.\n\nOne last thing that frustrates Speaker B is that they are fairly mutual with the moderators regarding other matters, but that title creates a barrier between everyone and the moderators.", "c1_input": "Speaker A, Cranesbill, expressed frustration over the perceived misuse of artistic work in AI training, suggesting that the community's concerns were being ignored.

After receiving an overwhelming amount of comments and support, Speaker B took some space, and Speaker A sent an \u201capology\u201d message.\n\nSpeaker B remained largely unresponsive aside from a few texts, and today, Speaker A texted to say she was \u201cjust kind of over it.\u201d Speaker B feels that the entire situation has become so absurd that they can\u2019t help but laugh.

They were in a postictal state and still very vulnerable when they posted, and it became apparent quickly that they were under-reacting, if anything.\n\nFor those concerned about Speaker B driving, they will not be behind the wheel for at least six months, as it is six months seizure-free in their state. When Speaker B informed Speaker A that they weren\u2019t sure if they could drive, they were still very much out of it and not thinking about their state\u2019s driving laws.\n\nRegarding why Speaker B did not immediately seek medical attention, they explain that they were confused and focused on the first thing in front of them. Additionally, healthcare is not free in their area, and Speaker B already has thousands of dollars in medical bills. Speaker A took Speaker B in for a CT scan regardless, and their head is okay; however, calling an ambulance was essentially out of the question unless their head had been gushing blood.\n\nSpeaker B expresses gratitude for the kindness, compassion, and support received.

I would just like for things to be clear. I want transparency not just honesty. Im not even a close minded person.
