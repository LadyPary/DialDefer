These will be all the possible $p_j$'s.\nFirst, there are two kinds of segments joining the midpoints of every pair of edges belonging to the same face of $Q$: <i>long traces</i> are those connecting the midpoint of opposite sides of the same face of $Q$, and <i>short traces</i> are those connecting the midpoint of adjacent sides of the same face of $Q$.\nSuppose $p_j$ contains a short trace $t_1$ of a face of $Q$. Then it must also contain some trace $t_2$ of an adjacent face of $Q$, where $t_2$ share a common endpoint with $t_1$. So, there are three possibilities for $t_2$, each of which determines a plane $p_j$ containing both $t_1$ and $t_2$.\n<b>Case 1:</b> $t_2$ makes an acute angle with $t_1$. In this case, $p_j \\cap Q$ is an equilateral triangle made by three short traces. There are $8$ of them, corresponding to the $8$ vertices.\n<b>Case 2:</b> $t_2$ is a long trace. $p \\cap Q$ is a rectangle. Each pair of parallel faces of $Q$ contributes $4$ of these rectangles so there are $12$ such rectangles.\n<b>Case 3:</b> $t_2$ is the short trace other than the one described in case 1, i.e. $t_2$ makes an obtuse angle with $t_1$. It is possible to prove that $p \\cap Q$ is a regular hexagon (See note #1 for a proof) and there are $4$ of them.\n<b>Case 4:</b> $p_j$ contains no short traces. This can only make $p_j \\cap Q$ be a square enclosed by long traces. There are $3$ such squares.\nIn total, there are $8+12+4+3=27$ possible planes in $P$. So the maximum of $k$ is $27$.\nOn the other hand, the most economic way to generate these long and short traces is to take all the planes in case 3 and case 4. Overall, they intersect at each trace exactly once (there is a quick way to prove this. See note #2 below.) and also covered all the $6\\times 4 + 4\\times 3 = 36$ traces. So the minimum of $k$ is $7$. The answer to this problem is then $27-7=20$ ... $\\boxed{20}$.\n<b>Note 1</b>: Indeed, let $t_1=AB$ where $B=t_1\\cap t_2$, and $C$ be the other endpoint of $t_2$ that is not $B$. Draw a line through $A$ parallel to $t_1$. This line passes through the center $O$ of the cube and therefore we see that the reflection of $A,B,C$, denoted by $A', B', C'$, respectively, lie on the same plane containing $A,B,C$. Thus $p_j \\cap Q$ is the regular hexagon $ABCA'B'C'$. To count the number of these hexagons, just notice that each short trace uniquely determine a hexagon (by drawing the plane through this trace and the center), and that each face has $4$ short traces. Therefore, there are $4$ such hexagons.\n<b>Note 2</b>: The quick way to prove the fact that none of the planes described in case 3 and case 4 share the same trace is as follows: each of these plane contains the center and therefore the intersection of each pair of them is a line through the center, which obviously does not contain any traces.", "num_solutions": 1, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$20$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$12$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: Distinct planes $p_1,p_2,....,p_k$ intersect the interior of a cube $Q$.

Therefore, the 4th tank has 20 + 6 = 26 guppies, but the pattern and total suggest a simpler direct calculation showing the 4th tank has 21 guppies.\"\\n}'}]"}

Since these are equal, we can set them equal to each other: 0.25J = 0.10S. Simplifying, we get J = 0.4S. Substituting J = 0.4S into J + S = 28 gives us 0.4S + S = 28, which simplifies to 1.4S = 28. Solving for S, we find S = 20. Therefore, J = 28 - 20 = 8. Since D = 0.25J = 0.25 * 8 = 2, and the number of juniors and seniors on the team is equal, there are 2 juniors and 2 seniors on the team.

The five terms are $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4$, and the sum is $a(1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4)$. Clearly $r$ must be rational for all terms to be integers. If $r$ were an integer, it could not be $1$, since $a$ would equal $\\frac{211}{1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4}$, which is not an integer. In fact, quickly testing $r = 2, 3, 4$ shows that $r$ cannot be an integer.\nWe now consider non-integers. If $r = \\frac{x}{y}$ and $\\gcd(x, y) = 1$, then $a$ would have to be divisible by $y^4$, since $ar^4 = a\\frac{x^4}{y^4}$ is an integer. If $y = 3$, then $a$ would have to be a multiple of $81$, which would make the five terms sum to at least $5 \\cdot 81$. It only gets worse if $y > 3$. Thus, $y = 2$, and $a$ is a multiple of $2^4 = 16$. Let $a = 16k$.\nWe now look at the last term, $ar^4 = 16k\\frac{x^4}{16} = kx^4$. The smallest allowable values for $x$, given that $x$ cannot be even, are $3$ and $5$. If $x = 5$, the last term will be way too big. Thus, $x = 3$ is the only possibility.\nWe now have a sum of $a(1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4) = 211$, and we know that $r = \\frac{3}{2}$ is the only possibility.

This can easily be shown with coordinates: any triangle of this sort may be labelled with right angle at $P(a,b)$, other vertices $Q(a,b+2c)$ and $R(a-2d,b)$, and thus midpoints $(a,b+c)$ and $(a-d,b)$, so that the slopes are $\\frac{c}{2d}$ and $\\frac{2c}{d} = 4(\\frac{c}{2d})$, thus showing that one is $4$ times the other as required.\nThus in our problem, $m$ is either $3 \\times 4 = 12$ or $3 \\div 4 = \\frac{3}{4}$. In fact, both are possible, and each for infinitely many triangles. We shall show this for $m=12$, and the argument is analogous for $m=\\frac{3}{4}$. Take any right triangle with legs parallel to the axes and a hypotenuse with slope $12 \\div 2 = 6$, e.g. the triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,6)$. Then quick calculations show that the medians to the legs have slopes $12$ and $3$. Now translate the triangle (without rotating it) so that its medians intersect at the point where the lines $y=12x+2$ and $y=3x+1$ intersect. This forces the medians to lie on these lines (since their slopes are determined, and now we force them to go through a particular point; a slope and a point uniquely determine a line). Finally, for any central dilation of this triangle (a larger or smaller triangle with the same centroid and sides parallel to this one's sides), the medians will still lie on these lines, showing the \"infinitely many\" part of the result.\nHence, to sum up, $m$ can in fact be both $12$ or $\\frac{3}{4}$, which is exactly $2$ values, i.e. $\\boxed{2}$.", "num_solutions": 1, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$2$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$1$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: It is desired to construct a right triangle in the coordinate plane so that its legs are parallel to the $x$ and $y$ axes and so that the medians to the midpoints of the legs lie on the lines $y = 3x + 1$ and $y = mx + 2$.

Further, let the perpendicular from $C$ to $\\overleftrightarrow{OB}$ have foot $D$ and length $c$, as in the diagram. Also, let $\\measuredangle OAB=\\alpha$. From the problem, we have $AB=a$ and $BC=b$. By AA similarity, we have $\\triangle OCB \\sim \\triangle OBA$, so $\\measuredangle CBO=\\alpha$ as well. In $\\triangle ABC$, we see that $\\sin\\alpha=\\frac{b}{a}$, and, in $\\triangle CDB$, $\\sin\\alpha=\\frac{c}{b}$. Equating these two expressions for $\\sin\\alpha$, we get that $\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{c}{b}$, or, because $a,b,c>0$, $b=\\sqrt{ac}$. Thus, $b$ is the geometric mean of $a$ and $c$. Note that if we remove the first perpendicular (i.e. the one with length $a$), we are left with a smaller version of the original problem, which will have the same equation for the limit (but this time expressed in terms of $b$ and $c$ rather than $a$ and $b$). Thus, if we let the length of the fourth perpendicular be $d$, then $c$ will equal the geometric mean of $b$ and $d$, and so on for the infinitude of perpendiculars. Thus, because the length of a given perpendicular (except the first one) is the geometric mean of the two adjacent perpendiculars, the lengths of the perpendiculars form a geometric sequence.

It must be that $\\overline{AP}$ divides the diagonal into two segments in the ratio $\\sqrt{3}$ to $1$. It is not difficult to visualize that when the square is rotated, the initial and final squares overlap in a rectangular region of dimensions $2\\sqrt{3}$ by $\\sqrt{3} + 1$. The area of the overall region (of the initial and final squares) is therefore twice the area of the original square minus the overlap, or $2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)^2 - 2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) = 2 (4 + 2 \\sqrt{3}) - 2 \\sqrt{3} - 2 = 6 + 2 \\sqrt{3}$.\nThe area also includes $4$ circular segments. Two are quarter-circles centered at $P$ of radii $\\sqrt{2}$ (the segment bounded by $\\overline{PA}$ and $\\overline{PA'}$) and $\\sqrt{6}$ (that bounded by $\\overline{PC}$ and $\\overline{PC'}$). Assuming $A$ is the bottom-left vertex and $B$ is the bottom-right one, it is clear that the third segment is formed as $B$ swings out to the right of the original square [recall that the square is rotated counterclockwise], while the fourth is formed when $D$ overshoots the final square's left edge. To find these areas, consider the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$. Call the point of intersection $E$. From the previous paragraph, it is clear that $PE = \\sqrt{3}$ and $BE = 1$. This means $PB = 2$, and $B$ swings back inside edge $\\overline{BC}$ at a point $1$ unit above $E$ (since it left the edge $1$ unit below). The triangle of the circular sector is therefore an equilateral triangle of side length $2$, and so the angle of the segment is $60^{\\circ}$. Imagining the process in reverse, it is clear that the situation is the same with point $D$.\nThe area of the segments can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle from that of the sector; it follows that the two quarter-segments have areas $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{2})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1$ and $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{6} \\sqrt{6} = \\frac{3 \\pi}{2} - 3$.

Therefore, in the case where $x \\geq 0$, substituting $x = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}$ gives\n\\[40\\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rfloor-51 = n.\\] To proceed, let $a$ be the unique non-negative integer such that $a \\leq \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2} < a+1$, so that \\begin{align*}&\\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rfloor = a, \\text{ and} \\\\ &4a^2 \\leq n < 4a^2+8a+4,\\end{align*} and our equation reduces to \\[40a-51 = n.\\]\nThe above inequalities therefore become \\[4a^2 \\leq 40a-51 < 4a^2+8a+4 \\iff 4a^2-40a+51 < 0 \\text{ and } 4a^2-32a+55 > 0,\\] where the first inequality can now be rewritten as $(2a-10)^2 \\leq 49$, i.e. $\\left\\lvert 2a-10\\right\\rvert \\leq 7$.

Then $D = x^2 + (x+1)^2 + x^2(x+1)^2$, which simplifies to $x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$.\nFrom the options, we want to test if $D$ is always a perfect square. Because the polynomial expression for $D$ is quartic, if it is a perfect square, it would be the square of a quadratic expression. Thus, $D$ could be written in the form $(Ax^2 + Bx + C)^2$ for some $(A, B, C)$.\nSetting $(Ax^2 + Bx + C)^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$, we can compare coefficients. From the $x^4$ coefficient, we get $A = \\pm 1$. Note that if $(Ax^2 + Bx^2 + C)^2$ works, so does $(-Ax^2 - Bx - C)^2$, so we can arbitrarily pick $A=1$.\nWe now have $(x^2 + Bx + C)^2= x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$. Setting the cubic terms equal gives $2B = 2$, or $B = 1$. This leaves $(x^2 + x + C)^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$. We can quickly inspect the constant term to determine that $C = \\pm 1$. We reject $C = -1$, since the quadratic and linear terms won't match up, which leaves $(x^2 + x + 1)^2$ as the only possibility - and, in fact, it works.\nThus, $D$ is always the square of an integer - namely $x^2 + x + 1$. This in turn means that $\\sqrt{D}$ is always rational, which leaves choices $A, B, C$ as the only possible correct answers.\nThe question now is whether $\\sqrt{D}$, or $x^2 + x + 1$, is odd, even, or could be both. We have two cases for $x$:\nIf $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, then $x^2 \\equiv 0^2 \\pmod 2$. This means $x^2 + x + 1 \\equiv 0 + 0 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. \nIf $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, then $x^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\pmod 2$, and $x^2 + x + 1 \\equiv 1 + 1 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. \nEither way, $x^2 + x + 1$ is an odd integer, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{always an odd integer}}$", "num_solutions": 1, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$\\text{always an odd integer}$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$\\text{sometimes rational, sometimes not}$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: Let $D=a^2+b^2+c^2$, where $a$, $b$, are consecutive integers and $c=ab$.

We draw a line to point $D$ on hypotenuse $AB$ such that $\\angle QDR$ is $90 ^\\circ$ and that $RDQC$ is a rectangle. Since triangle $RCQ$ is similar to triangle $ABC$, let $RC$ be $4x$ and $RD/CQ$ be $3x$. Now we have line segment $AQ$ = $8-3x$, and line segment $RB$ = $6-4x$.

Since $O_a$ is an incenter, it lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle ACD$. Similarly, $O_b$ lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle BCD$.

Since the circles are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii. Let\\'s denote the radius of the smaller circle as \\\\(r\\\\) and the larger circle as \\\\(R\\\\). The distance between the centers is \\\\(r + R\\\\). From the diagram, we can see that the distance PB is twice the length of PA, which means PB = 8. This distance can also be seen as the sum of the radii plus the segment between the points of tangency on the line, which is essentially the diameter of the smaller circle plus the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller circle. Given the symmetry and the fact that PA = AB = 4, it implies that the radius of the smaller circle is 2 (since PA is a tangent and equals the radius of the smaller circle).

What was the total number of points scored by the two teams in the first half?", "correct_answers": ["$34$"], "incorrect_answers": ["$33$", "$32$", "$31$", "$30$"], "context": null, "meta": {"year": "2010", "contest": "AMC_12B", "number": 19, "level": 3, "subject": "algebra", "multiple_choice_only": false, "solution": "Let $a,ar,ar^{2},ar^{3}$ be the quarterly scores for the Raiders. We know $r > 1$ because the sequence is said to be increasing. We also know that each of $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3$ is an integer. We start by showing that <b>$r$ must also be an integer.</b>\nSuppose not, and say $r = m/n$ where $m>n>1$, and $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. Then $n, n^2, n^3$ must all divide $a$ so $a=n^3k$ for some integer $k$. Then $S_R = n^3k + n^2mk + nm^2k + m^3k < 100$ and we see that even if $k=1$ and $n=2$, we get $m < 4$, which means that the only option for $r$ is $r=3/2$. A quick check shows that even this doesn't work. Thus $r$ must be an integer.\nLet $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d$ be the quarterly scores for the Wildcats. Let $S_W = a+(a+d) + (a+2d)+(a+3d) = 4a+6d$. Let $S_R = a+ar+ar^2+ar^3 = a(1+r)(1+r^2)$. Then $S_R<100$ implies that $r<5$, so $r\\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$. The Raiders win by one point, so\\[a(1+r)(1+r^2) = 4a+6d+1.\\]\n* If $r=4$ we get $85a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $3(27a-2d) = 1$, which is not possible with the given conditions.\n* If $r=3$ we get $40a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $6(6a-d) = 1$, which is also not possible with the given conditions.\n* If $r=2$ we get $15a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $11a-6d = 1$. Reducing modulo 6 we get $a \\equiv 5\\pmod{6}$. Since $15a<100$ we get $a<7$. Thus $a=5$. It then follows that $d=9$.\nThen the quarterly scores for the Raiders are $5, 10, 20, 40$, and those for the Wildcats are $5, 14, 23, 32$. Also $S_R = 75 = S_W + 1$. The total number of points scored by the two teams in the first half is $5+10+5+14=\\boxed{34}$.\nNote if you don't realize while taking the test that $r$ might not be an integer: since an answer is achieved through casework on the integer value of $r$ and since there is only one right answer, the proof of $r$ being an integer can be skipped on the test (it takes up time).", "num_solutions": 2, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$34$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$33$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: A high school basketball game between the Raiders and Wildcats was tied at the end of the first quarter.

Let $a$ denote the numerator, and $b$ denote the denominator. Let's first work on finding $b$, the total number. \nFor a regular digit, there are $10$ possible choices to make: $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$. The only digit that is not regular is the first one, which prohibits $0$ and $1$ from taking place, resulting in $8$ possible choices to make for that first digit. Since each digit is independent of one another, we multiply the number of choices for each digit, resulting in $8 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10$, or $8 * 10 ^ 6$ possible total phone numbers ($b$). \nNow that we have the denominator, the only unknown remaining is $b$. To solve for $a$, let's use the same method as we did for the denominator. For the first digit, there is only one possible value: $9$. For the last digit, there is only one possible value: $0$. However, the rest of the five digits are \"free\" (meaning they can be any one of $10$ choices). Thus $a = 1 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 1$, or $10^5$ possible phone numbers with restrictions. \nThe fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ is the same as $\\frac{10^5}{8 * 10^6}$, which reduces to $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{80}}$.\n(~thelinguist46295)", "num_solutions": 2, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$\\frac{1}{80}$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$\\frac{1}{100}$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: Assume every 7-digit whole number is a possible telephone number except those that begin with $0$ or $1$.
