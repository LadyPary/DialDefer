These will be all the possible $p_j$'s.\nFirst, there are two kinds of segments joining the midpoints of every pair of edges belonging to the same face of $Q$: <i>long traces</i> are those connecting the midpoint of opposite sides of the same face of $Q$, and <i>short traces</i> are those connecting the midpoint of adjacent sides of the same face of $Q$.\nSuppose $p_j$ contains a short trace $t_1$ of a face of $Q$. Then it must also contain some trace $t_2$ of an adjacent face of $Q$, where $t_2$ share a common endpoint with $t_1$. So, there are three possibilities for $t_2$, each of which determines a plane $p_j$ containing both $t_1$ and $t_2$.\n<b>Case 1:</b> $t_2$ makes an acute angle with $t_1$. In this case, $p_j \\cap Q$ is an equilateral triangle made by three short traces. There are $8$ of them, corresponding to the $8$ vertices.\n<b>Case 2:</b> $t_2$ is a long trace. $p \\cap Q$ is a rectangle. Each pair of parallel faces of $Q$ contributes $4$ of these rectangles so there are $12$ such rectangles.\n<b>Case 3:</b> $t_2$ is the short trace other than the one described in case 1, i.e. $t_2$ makes an obtuse angle with $t_1$. It is possible to prove that $p \\cap Q$ is a regular hexagon (See note #1 for a proof) and there are $4$ of them.\n<b>Case 4:</b> $p_j$ contains no short traces. This can only make $p_j \\cap Q$ be a square enclosed by long traces. There are $3$ such squares.\nIn total, there are $8+12+4+3=27$ possible planes in $P$. So the maximum of $k$ is $27$.\nOn the other hand, the most economic way to generate these long and short traces is to take all the planes in case 3 and case 4. Overall, they intersect at each trace exactly once (there is a quick way to prove this. See note #2 below.) and also covered all the $6\\times 4 + 4\\times 3 = 36$ traces. So the minimum of $k$ is $7$. The answer to this problem is then $27-7=20$ ... $\\boxed{20}$.\n<b>Note 1</b>: Indeed, let $t_1=AB$ where $B=t_1\\cap t_2$, and $C$ be the other endpoint of $t_2$ that is not $B$. Draw a line through $A$ parallel to $t_1$. This line passes through the center $O$ of the cube and therefore we see that the reflection of $A,B,C$, denoted by $A', B', C'$, respectively, lie on the same plane containing $A,B,C$. Thus $p_j \\cap Q$ is the regular hexagon $ABCA'B'C'$. To count the number of these hexagons, just notice that each short trace uniquely determine a hexagon (by drawing the plane through this trace and the center), and that each face has $4$ short traces. Therefore, there are $4$ such hexagons.\n<b>Note 2</b>: The quick way to prove the fact that none of the planes described in case 3 and case 4 share the same trace is as follows: each of these plane contains the center and therefore the intersection of each pair of them is a line through the center, which obviously does not contain any traces.", "num_solutions": 1, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$20$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$12$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: Distinct planes $p_1,p_2,....,p_k$ intersect the interior of a cube $Q$.

The greatest value of $PQ$ happens when $P$ and $Q$ are almost directly across from each other and are in different quadrants. For example, the endpoints of the segment could be $(-4,3)$ and $(3,-4)$ because the two points are almost across from each other. Another possible pair could be $(-4,3)$ and $(5,0)$. To find out which segment is longer, we have to compare the distances from their endpoints to a diameter (which must be the longest possible segment). The closest diameter would be from $(-4,3)$ to $(4,-3)$. The distance between $(3,-4)$ and $(-4,3)$ is greater than the distance between $(5,0)$ and $(4,-3)$.

The five terms are $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4$, and the sum is $a(1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4)$. Clearly $r$ must be rational for all terms to be integers. If $r$ were an integer, it could not be $1$, since $a$ would equal $\\frac{211}{1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4}$, which is not an integer. In fact, quickly testing $r = 2, 3, 4$ shows that $r$ cannot be an integer.\nWe now consider non-integers. If $r = \\frac{x}{y}$ and $\\gcd(x, y) = 1$, then $a$ would have to be divisible by $y^4$, since $ar^4 = a\\frac{x^4}{y^4}$ is an integer. If $y = 3$, then $a$ would have to be a multiple of $81$, which would make the five terms sum to at least $5 \\cdot 81$. It only gets worse if $y > 3$. Thus, $y = 2$, and $a$ is a multiple of $2^4 = 16$. Let $a = 16k$.\nWe now look at the last term, $ar^4 = 16k\\frac{x^4}{16} = kx^4$. The smallest allowable values for $x$, given that $x$ cannot be even, are $3$ and $5$. If $x = 5$, the last term will be way too big. Thus, $x = 3$ is the only possibility.\nWe now have a sum of $a(1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4) = 211$, and we know that $r = \\frac{3}{2}$ is the only possibility. The terms in the parentheses happen to equal $\\frac{211}{16}$ when you plug them in, so $a = 16$.\nThus, the terms are $16, 24, 36, 54, 81$, and the first, third, and fifth terms are squares, with a sum of $133$, which is answer $\\boxed{133}$.", "num_solutions": 1, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$133$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$195$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: Given a geometric progression of five terms, each a positive integer less than $100$.

This can easily be shown with coordinates: any triangle of this sort may be labelled with right angle at $P(a,b)$, other vertices $Q(a,b+2c)$ and $R(a-2d,b)$, and thus midpoints $(a,b+c)$ and $(a-d,b)$, so that the slopes are $\\frac{c}{2d}$ and $\\frac{2c}{d} = 4(\\frac{c}{2d})$, thus showing that one is $4$ times the other as required.\nThus in our problem, $m$ is either $3 \\times 4 = 12$ or $3 \\div 4 = \\frac{3}{4}$. In fact, both are possible, and each for infinitely many triangles. We shall show this for $m=12$, and the argument is analogous for $m=\\frac{3}{4}$.

Now translate the triangle (without rotating it) so that its medians intersect at the point where the lines $y=12x+2$ and $y=3x+1$ intersect. This forces the medians to lie on these lines (since their slopes are determined, and now we force them to go through a particular point; a slope and a point uniquely determine a line). Finally, for any central dilation of this triangle (a larger or smaller triangle with the same centroid and sides parallel to this one's sides), the medians will still lie on these lines, showing the \"infinitely many\" part of the result.\nHence, to sum up, $m$ can in fact be both $12$ or $\\frac{3}{4}$, which is exactly $2$ values, i.e. $\\boxed{2}$.", "num_solutions": 1, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$2$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$1$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: It is desired to construct a right triangle in the coordinate plane so that its legs are parallel to the $x$ and $y$ axes and so that the medians to the midpoints of the legs lie on the lines $y = 3x + 1$ and $y = mx + 2$.

Further, let the perpendicular from $C$ to $\\overleftrightarrow{OB}$ have foot $D$ and length $c$, as in the diagram. Also, let $\\measuredangle OAB=\\alpha$. From the problem, we have $AB=a$ and $BC=b$. By AA similarity, we have $\\triangle OCB \\sim \\triangle OBA$, so $\\measuredangle CBO=\\alpha$ as well. In $\\triangle ABC$, we see that $\\sin\\alpha=\\frac{b}{a}$, and, in $\\triangle CDB$, $\\sin\\alpha=\\frac{c}{b}$. Equating these two expressions for $\\sin\\alpha$, we get that $\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{c}{b}$, or, because $a,b,c>0$, $b=\\sqrt{ac}$. Thus, $b$ is the geometric mean of $a$ and $c$. Note that if we remove the first perpendicular (i.e. the one with length $a$), we are left with a smaller version of the original problem, which will have the same equation for the limit (but this time expressed in terms of $b$ and $c$ rather than $a$ and $b$). Thus, if we let the length of the fourth perpendicular be $d$, then $c$ will equal the geometric mean of $b$ and $d$, and so on for the infinitude of perpendiculars. Thus, because the length of a given perpendicular (except the first one) is the geometric mean of the two adjacent perpendiculars, the lengths of the perpendiculars form a geometric sequence. Because the sequence's first two terms are $a$ and $b$, it has common ratio $\\frac{b}{a}$. Because $b<a$, the common ratio is positive and less than $1$, so the sequence's infinite geometric series converges.

It must be that $\\overline{AP}$ divides the diagonal into two segments in the ratio $\\sqrt{3}$ to $1$. It is not difficult to visualize that when the square is rotated, the initial and final squares overlap in a rectangular region of dimensions $2\\sqrt{3}$ by $\\sqrt{3} + 1$. The area of the overall region (of the initial and final squares) is therefore twice the area of the original square minus the overlap, or $2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)^2 - 2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) = 2 (4 + 2 \\sqrt{3}) - 2 \\sqrt{3} - 2 = 6 + 2 \\sqrt{3}$.\nThe area also includes $4$ circular segments. Two are quarter-circles centered at $P$ of radii $\\sqrt{2}$ (the segment bounded by $\\overline{PA}$ and $\\overline{PA'}$) and $\\sqrt{6}$ (that bounded by $\\overline{PC}$ and $\\overline{PC'}$). Assuming $A$ is the bottom-left vertex and $B$ is the bottom-right one, it is clear that the third segment is formed as $B$ swings out to the right of the original square [recall that the square is rotated counterclockwise], while the fourth is formed when $D$ overshoots the final square's left edge. To find these areas, consider the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$. Call the point of intersection $E$. From the previous paragraph, it is clear that $PE = \\sqrt{3}$ and $BE = 1$. This means $PB = 2$, and $B$ swings back inside edge $\\overline{BC}$ at a point $1$ unit above $E$ (since it left the edge $1$ unit below). The triangle of the circular sector is therefore an equilateral triangle of side length $2$, and so the angle of the segment is $60^{\\circ}$. Imagining the process in reverse, it is clear that the situation is the same with point $D$.\nThe area of the segments can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle from that of the sector; it follows that the two quarter-segments have areas $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{2})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1$ and $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{6} \\sqrt{6} = \\frac{3 \\pi}{2} - 3$.

Therefore, in the case where $x \\geq 0$, substituting $x = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}$ gives\n\\[40\\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rfloor-51 = n.\\] To proceed, let $a$ be the unique non-negative integer such that $a \\leq \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2} < a+1$, so that \\begin{align*}&\\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rfloor = a, \\text{ and} \\\\ &4a^2 \\leq n < 4a^2+8a+4,\\end{align*} and our equation reduces to \\[40a-51 = n.\\]\nThe above inequalities therefore become \\[4a^2 \\leq 40a-51 < 4a^2+8a+4 \\iff 4a^2-40a+51 < 0 \\text{ and } 4a^2-32a+55 > 0,\\] where the first inequality can now be rewritten as $(2a-10)^2 \\leq 49$, i.e. $\\left\\lvert 2a-10\\right\\rvert \\leq 7$. Since $(2a-10)$ is even for all integers $a$, we must in fact have \\begin{align*}\\left\\lvert 2a-10\\right\\rvert \\leq 6 &\\iff \\left\\lvert a-5\\right\\rvert \\leq 3 \\\\ &\\iff 2 \\leq a \\leq 8.\\end{align*} The second inequality similarly simplifies to $(2a-8)^2 > 9$, i.e. $\\left\\lvert 2a-8\\right\\rvert > 3$.

Since $n = 40a-51$, each of these distinct values of $a$ gives a distinct solution for $n$, and thus for $x = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}$, giving a total of $4$ solutions in the $x \\geq 0$ case.\nAs $4$ is already the largest of the answer choices, this suffices to show that the answer is $\\text{(E)}$, but for completeness, we will show that the $x < 0$ case indeed gives no other solutions. If $x = -\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}$ (and so $n > 0$), we require \\[40\\left\\lfloor -\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rfloor-51 = n,\\] and recalling that $\\left\\lfloor -x\\right\\rfloor = -\\left\\lceil x\\right\\rceil$ for all $x$, this equation can be rewritten as \\[-40\\left\\lceil \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rceil-51 = n.\\] Since $n$ is positive, the least possible value of $\\left\\lceil \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rceil$ is $1$, but this means \\begin{align*}n &= -40\\left\\lceil\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2}\\right\\rceil-51 \\\\ &\\leq -40 \\cdot 1 - 51 \\\\ &= -91,\\end{align*} which is a contradiction.

Then $D = x^2 + (x+1)^2 + x^2(x+1)^2$, which simplifies to $x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$.\nFrom the options, we want to test if $D$ is always a perfect square. Because the polynomial expression for $D$ is quartic, if it is a perfect square, it would be the square of a quadratic expression. Thus, $D$ could be written in the form $(Ax^2 + Bx + C)^2$ for some $(A, B, C)$.\nSetting $(Ax^2 + Bx + C)^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$, we can compare coefficients. From the $x^4$ coefficient, we get $A = \\pm 1$. Note that if $(Ax^2 + Bx^2 + C)^2$ works, so does $(-Ax^2 - Bx - C)^2$, so we can arbitrarily pick $A=1$.\nWe now have $(x^2 + Bx + C)^2= x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$. Setting the cubic terms equal gives $2B = 2$, or $B = 1$. This leaves $(x^2 + x + C)^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$. We can quickly inspect the constant term to determine that $C = \\pm 1$. We reject $C = -1$, since the quadratic and linear terms won't match up, which leaves $(x^2 + x + 1)^2$ as the only possibility - and, in fact, it works.\nThus, $D$ is always the square of an integer - namely $x^2 + x + 1$. This in turn means that $\\sqrt{D}$ is always rational, which leaves choices $A, B, C$ as the only possible correct answers.\nThe question now is whether $\\sqrt{D}$, or $x^2 + x + 1$, is odd, even, or could be both. We have two cases for $x$:\nIf $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, then $x^2 \\equiv 0^2 \\pmod 2$. This means $x^2 + x + 1 \\equiv 0 + 0 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. \nIf $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, then $x^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\pmod 2$, and $x^2 + x + 1 \\equiv 1 + 1 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. \nEither way, $x^2 + x + 1$ is an odd integer, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{always an odd integer}}$", "num_solutions": 1, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$\\text{always an odd integer}$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$\\text{sometimes rational, sometimes not}$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: Let $D=a^2+b^2+c^2$, where $a$, $b$, are consecutive integers and $c=ab$.

We draw a line to point $D$ on hypotenuse $AB$ such that $\\angle QDR$ is $90 ^\\circ$ and that $RDQC$ is a rectangle. Since triangle $RCQ$ is similar to triangle $ABC$, let $RC$ be $4x$ and $RD/CQ$ be $3x$. Now we have line segment $AQ$ = $8-3x$, and line segment $RB$ = $6-4x$. Since $BD + DA = AB$, we use simple algebra and Pythagorean Theorem to get $\\sqrt {(3x)^2 + (6-4x)^2}$ + $\\sqrt {(4x)^2 + (8-3x)^2}$ = $10$. Expanding and simplifying gives us $\\sqrt {25x^2-48x+36}$ + $\\sqrt {25x^2-48x+64}$ = $10$. \nSquaring both sides is not an option since it is both messy and time consuming, so we should proceed to subtracting both sides by $\\sqrt {25x^2-48x+36}$. Now, we can square both sides and simplify to get $0 = 72 - 20 \\sqrt{25x^2-48x+36}$. Dividing both sides by $4$, we get $18 - 5 \\sqrt {25x^2-48x+36}$ = $0$. We then add $5 \\sqrt {25x^2-48x+36}$ to both sides to get $18 = 5 \\sqrt {25x^2-48x+36}$. Since this is very messy, let $25x^2 - 48x = y$. Squaring both sides, we get $324 = 25y + 900, 25y = -576$. Solving for $y$, we have $y = -23.04$. Plugging in $y$ as $25x^2-48x$, we have $25x^2-48x+23.04 = 0$. Using the quadratic equation, we get $\\frac {48+0}{50}$.

Using the angle bisector theorem, we see that $AD = \\frac{15}{7}$ and $BD = \\frac{20}{7}$. Using Stewart's Theorem gives us the equation $5d^2 + \\frac{1500}{49} = \\frac{240}{7} + \\frac{180}{7}$, where $d$ is the length of $CD$. Solving gives us $d = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7}$, so $CD = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7}$.\nCall the incenters of triangles $ACD$ and $BCD$ $O_a$ and $O_b$ respectively. Since $O_a$ is an incenter, it lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle ACD$. Similarly, $O_b$ lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle BCD$. Call the point on $CD$ tangent to $O_a$ $M$, and the point tangent to $O_b$ $N$. Since $\\triangle CO_aM$ and $\\triangle CO_bN$ are right, and $\\angle O_aCM = \\angle O_bCN$, $\\triangle CO_aM \\sim \\triangle CO_bN$. Then, $\\frac{r_a}{r_b} = \\frac{CM}{CN}$. \nWe now use common tangents to find the length of $CM$ and $CN$. Let $CM = m$, and the length of the other tangents be $n$ and $p$. Since common tangents are equal, we can write that $m + n = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{7}$, $n + p = \\frac{15}{7}$ and $m + p = 3$. Solving gives us that $CM = m = \\frac{6\\sqrt{2} + 3}{7}$.

At the end of the fourth quarter, the Raiders had won by one point. Neither team scored more than $100$ points. What was the total number of points scored by the two teams in the first half?", "correct_answers": ["$34$"], "incorrect_answers": ["$33$", "$32$", "$31$", "$30$"], "context": null, "meta": {"year": "2010", "contest": "AMC_12B", "number": 19, "level": 3, "subject": "algebra", "multiple_choice_only": false, "solution": "Let $a,ar,ar^{2},ar^{3}$ be the quarterly scores for the Raiders. We know $r > 1$ because the sequence is said to be increasing. We also know that each of $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3$ is an integer. We start by showing that <b>$r$ must also be an integer.</b>\nSuppose not, and say $r = m/n$ where $m>n>1$, and $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. Then $n, n^2, n^3$ must all divide $a$ so $a=n^3k$ for some integer $k$. Then $S_R = n^3k + n^2mk + nm^2k + m^3k < 100$ and we see that even if $k=1$ and $n=2$, we get $m < 4$, which means that the only option for $r$ is $r=3/2$. A quick check shows that even this doesn't work. Thus $r$ must be an integer.\nLet $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d$ be the quarterly scores for the Wildcats. Let $S_W = a+(a+d) + (a+2d)+(a+3d) = 4a+6d$. Let $S_R = a+ar+ar^2+ar^3 = a(1+r)(1+r^2)$. Then $S_R<100$ implies that $r<5$, so $r\\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$. The Raiders win by one point, so\\[a(1+r)(1+r^2) = 4a+6d+1.\\]\n* If $r=4$ we get $85a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $3(27a-2d) = 1$, which is not possible with the given conditions.\n* If $r=3$ we get $40a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $6(6a-d) = 1$, which is also not possible with the given conditions.\n* If $r=2$ we get $15a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $11a-6d = 1$. Reducing modulo 6 we get $a \\equiv 5\\pmod{6}$. Since $15a<100$ we get $a<7$. Thus $a=5$. It then follows that $d=9$.\nThen the quarterly scores for the Raiders are $5, 10, 20, 40$, and those for the Wildcats are $5, 14, 23, 32$. Also $S_R = 75 = S_W + 1$. The total number of points scored by the two teams in the first half is $5+10+5+14=\\boxed{34}$.\nNote if you don't realize while taking the test that $r$ might not be an integer: since an answer is achieved through casework on the integer value of $r$ and since there is only one right answer, the proof of $r$ being an integer can be skipped on the test (it takes up time).", "num_solutions": 2, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$34$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$33$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: A high school basketball game between the Raiders and Wildcats was tied at the end of the first quarter.
