He developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. The patient noted facial muscle twitching and developed a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 3 minutes, 4 hours following the onset of his condition. His past medical history is insignificant for any seizure disorders, and he does not take any medications. His blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg, heart rate is 104/min, respiratory rate is 10/min, and the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient’s consciousness is decreased with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. He is pale and sweaty. His lung sounds are normal, cardiac sounds are decreased, and no murmurs are present. Abdominal palpation reveals epigastric tenderness. Neurological examination shows rapid downbeating nystagmus, facial muscle twitching, and symmetrically decreased sensation to all the sensory modalities on both the upper and lower extremities.
