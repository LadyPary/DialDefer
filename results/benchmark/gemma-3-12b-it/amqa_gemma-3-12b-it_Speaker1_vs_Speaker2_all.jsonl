Your task to choose the correct answer and write your reasoning.\\n<<<CHATLOG>>>\\nSpeaker 1: A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after feeling sad and depressed for the past several months. His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it\\'s the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). His physical exam is normal.

The patient’s son says he has difficulty remembering recent events and names. He says the patient’s symptoms have progressively worsened over the last several years but became acutely worse just recently. Also, yesterday, the patient complained that he could not see out of his right eye, but today he can. When asked about these concerns, the patient seems to have no insight into the problem and reports feeling well. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. Current medications are amlodipine, aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, sitagliptin, and valsartan. He lives with his son and can feed himself and change his clothes. There is no history of urinary or fecal incontinence. His vitals include: blood pressure 137/82 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. He is unable to perform simple arithmetic calculations and the mini-mental status exam is inconclusive. He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes.
