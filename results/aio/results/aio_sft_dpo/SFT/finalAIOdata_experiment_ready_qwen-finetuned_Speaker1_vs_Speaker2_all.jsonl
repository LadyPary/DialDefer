Speaker B wants to know who is in the wrong because Speaker B is unable to look at the situation as clearly anymore.\n\n**BACKSTORY:**\n\nSpeaker A (M45) and Speaker B (F27) met in 2022 when Speaker B started working at the same restaurant where Speaker A was already employed. They didn't really talk much, but six months into Speaker B's employment, Speaker A started to show interest and tried to pursue Speaker B. It took about three months for Speaker B to give Speaker A a chance. After their first time hanging out, Speaker A told Speaker B that he had been single for some time and was looking for someone to do things with, like concerts, dinners, vacations, etc., but wanted to keep it light. Given the 17-year age difference, Speaker A also mentioned he wouldn't want anything too serious with Speaker B since he didn't want to \"steal her youth\" or take away any experiences she should be having at her age. Speaker B expressed that she loved all those activities and would be down for them, but she thought Speaker A was just trying to impress her. Speaker A asked Speaker B to name an artist she liked and if she had ever been to Hawaii, to which Speaker B replied yes (Speaker A had never been). A couple of days later, Speaker A booked a trip to Hawaii for them, but they had to stop in Las Vegas first to see the artist Speaker B liked, who was performing the day before their flights to Hawaii. Speaker B was surprised that it wasn't all talk. During that vacation, they had a mix of fun and getting to know each other and how they function as partners in relationships. Speaker B mentioned that she cooks but isn't the best at cleaning, to which Speaker A responded that if she cooked, he would have no issue doing his part by cleaning and taking care of any \"manly\" duties. This was the start of their relationship, and they had been together ever since. They moved in together in 2023.\n\n**TODAY'S ISSUE:**\n\nFast forward to now, Speaker B hasn't worked with Speaker A in a while, but Speaker A uses work as an excuse not to do his part or even the bare minimum. His motto has always been \"quick and easy,\" and it's really getting to Speaker B that he is the lead server at his job, never calls out, and people praise all his hard work and efforts, yet he comes home \"too tired\" for anything more, as if Speaker B doesn't work herself. Speaker B is usually understanding when Speaker A says, \"But I work REALLY hard,\" but that doesn't mean he gets to check out. Speaker B has seen his work ethic because she worked there, and it's amazing; she just wishes there was some of that leftover for their home and their relationship. Speaker A goes out of his way to give coworkers rides and help people, which Speaker B appreciates, but once he's in the door, it's immediately to the couch and asking what's for dinner.\n\nYesterday (12/29) was their 2-year anniversary, and Speaker A promised he would take the day off, whether he had to request it off or call out; he would make it happen for Speaker B. Speaker B's only requests were to spend the day together and for Speaker A to make the reservation so she could be somewhat surprised. However, he didn't feel like making the reservation anywhere and said, \"ugh baby just pick one!\" So, Speaker B made two reservations at places she liked. Two days before the date, Speaker A tried to tell Speaker B he wanted to go to work, which upset her because he had months of notice and could easily request or switch the days off with his coworkers. He asked off for New Year's Day but not for their anniversary, which upset Speaker B even more, as he could have done both or just chosen one. He realized Speaker B was upset and said he would keep his word and that he understood her feelings. On the 28th at 10 PM, Speaker B got off work and called Speaker A to ask if she should pick up something to drink since they didn't work the next day. Speaker A said he was for sure going to work and was going back on his word yet again. He stated he didn't feel comfortable not going to work on their anniversary (Sunday) but would want to do something the next day, even though he was still scheduled. So, he would call out but just not that day? Attached is a picture of what Speaker B was met with. Speaker B is feeling frustrated because this is another promise Speaker A hasn't kept, along with other promises he leaves until the last second and then guilt trips her. Speaker B needs advice.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nSpeaker A promised to have anniversary plans but tried to go back on it, said never mind and that he understood Speaker B, and then actually did cancel. He said he didn't feel comfortable calling out of work on that day but would call out the next day and requested New Year's Day off when he could have easily requested their anniversary off instead or as well. Speaker A has a history of being wishy-washy when it comes to his word, and given the 17-year age gap, Speaker B is left conflicted.", "c1_input": "Speaker B expressed deep hurt and disappointment over promises that were broken, emphasizing accountability and their decision to distance themselves.

{"id": "1on4ee9", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B feels like they were manipulated by a man to become his side chick. Speaker B has very little dating experience, which has left them feeling confused about the situation. \n\nSpeaker B met this guy in their dancing class. At the end of the second class, he asked Speaker B if they would want to do some extra practice with him over the weekend. Speaker B agreed, and he messaged them the address later that night. They went to that studio to practice the following day. The studio is not easy to get to compared to others in the city, so it ended up just being the two of them dancing for three to four hours straight, which Speaker B did not know before going there. This weekend practice continued for another two to three weeks. He put effort into teaching Speaker B new movements, complimented their progress, and they started talking about other aspects of their lives. Speaker B could feel that he was making advances toward them. He offered to take Speaker B on a motorcycle ride when he found out they had never been on one before. Meanwhile, they kept seeing each other in the usual dancing class, and he consistently tried to dance with Speaker B for both the opening and closing dances, purposely walking toward them so they would be right next to him when those dances started. Speaker B thought, “I can spend a bit more time with him to see how things go.” It was always good to practice with someone who danced well, and he seemed to be a nice person.\n\nOne day after classes, he drove to Speaker B's place (he had dropped them off after the motorcycle ride, so he knew their address) and called them to come down because he needed to tell them something. He said he wanted to be fully honest and transparent with Speaker B because their dancing together could turn into “something else.” He explained that he was in a “contract” with a lady. They came from the same country and had known each other since childhood. When they moved to the area, they felt vulnerable and got together. The lady had told him at the very beginning that she had no intention of making the relationship long-term because she ultimately wanted to move to Spain, while he wanted to stay. However, he felt responsible for taking care of her and helping her get a partner visa with him. Their “contract” was supposed to end on September 25, but she decided to stay until January 26, extending the “contract.” They were separating because she was ultimately leaving, and January 26 would be a new start for him. After that conversation, Speaker B was under the impression that their relationship was now just for appearances for the sake of the lady’s visa and that there was little to no emotional substance left. Speaker B did not think this arrangement was right in many ways, but ultimately, whatever arrangement they had was not of Speaker B's concern. Speaker B thought they would just keep him at arm's length as someone to practice dancing with and did not think too much of it.\n\nThe next time they practiced together, they finished very late, so they went out of the studio to get some dinner. He again brought up the “contract” and said that the lady recognized it was unfair to him, so she allowed him space to go out dancing and meet other people. While they were eating, that lady actually called him, and he told her straight away that he was having dinner with Speaker B. After the call, he reiterated that they were going separate ways and everything would end in January, no matter what happened with that lady. Speaker B believed him because they could not think of why someone would be okay with their partner spending an extended amount of time dancing and hanging out with someone else. By that time, they had been practicing just the two of them for about a month. Speaker B was still feeling a bit unsure about the whole situation but did not want to appear judgmental of their arrangement. Speaker B was also on a visa and understood that sometimes it was a difficult situation to be in. They thought they would just see how things went because, at that time, Speaker B did not think he had bad intentions, so they accepted his advances, which now made Speaker B want to punch themselves.\n\nSpeaker B and the man started messaging each other every two to three days. He called Speaker B once or twice, and they talked about other hobbies, work, and family, making the conversations personal and sometimes a bit flirty. However, because of his “contract” with the lady, Speaker B never made up their mind regarding him.\n\nOne day, he messaged Speaker B saying he deleted some of their text messages on his phone. The lady found out and was not happy about it, so they broke up. Speaker B was very confused because they had always been under the impression that it was no longer an actual relationship and that they had already broken up. Speaker B instantly felt that he was lying and got a bit angry, replying, “Please don’t involve me in your problems, and I will not be going to that studio again.” He said he understood and that it was his fault. After thinking about it for a while, Speaker B considered that it could genuinely be a really messed-up situation and that it was never fun to break up with someone. They realized the tone of their message might have been a bit harsh for what he was going through. So when he messaged Speaker B saying he wouldn’t make it to class on time, Speaker B replied, “I hope you are doing okay.” He basically said he was trying to move on and then asked Speaker B to help him with his translation exam. This was not coming out of nowhere, as he had mentioned he had an exam the following week and Speaker B had done a similar exam before. Speaker B knew that could be an excuse he made up to see them, but they wanted to know what exactly happened, so they agreed to meet him.\n\nThey worked on his exam material and then went out to get some food afterward. Speaker B asked him what exactly happened. He repeated the same thing. Speaker B said, “I only let you make advances because I thought your relationship was just for appearances and for the lady’s visa, and she was allowing you to meet other people.” He then said that the lady’s visa was not actually a partner visa with him. He followed up by saying maybe he didn’t say it clearly, but it was his offer to get her a partner visa so she wouldn’t have to study and work at the same time, but the lady refused. Speaker B asked, “But you said she allows you to meet other people; was the relationship real or not?” He said, “Well, there are feelings left, and she saw the rest of the message and thought we had a physical relationship. Well, maybe in January we feel like it, it might happen. But yeah, she wasn’t happy, and she broke up with me. Well, there is nothing else then because we actually broke up. Though it was supposed to be January, now there is nothing left. And I need to move on.” Speaker B felt very confused, wondering when they had given him the idea that they might get physical. When they parted, he even tried to kiss Speaker B, but they resisted, saying, “This is going too quickly, and I am confused. We are not at the stage where I feel okay with you kissing me.” He said he understood, said goodbye, and left. Speaker B thought that was it; they stopped messaging for the whole week.\n\nHowever, last Friday in class (Halloween), he showed up early in costume (he knew Speaker B was always early because they took public transport and needed to be super early or they would be super late) and bought Speaker B a matching headpiece to wear. Speaker B did not think much of it, as it was just Halloween stuff. They were not that into dressing up as characters, but they wore it and danced the opening. While they were dancing, other people started to arrive and watched them dance. When the class started and they swapped dance partners, one girl asked him if he and Speaker B were sticking together and not changing partners (usually they rotate partners unless a couple comes together to class and says they want to stick together). Speaker B felt weird and was unsure if he had done the costume and dancing thing on purpose to let others see it. However, it would look rude if they refused to dance with him, so Speaker B did not say or do anything. Again, he grabbed Speaker B for the closing dance and walked them to the bus stop. Speaker B asked what the costume was about, and he just said it was Halloween. Speaker B thought they were just overthinking things. The next day, when they went to the dance school for practice (not the one that is hard to get to, but the one with a lot of other people), he seemed a bit distant. Speaker B thought if he wanted to distance himself, they would just let him. Plus, he was busy taking videos for the teachers for a demonstration, so Speaker B did not think much of it. He again followed Speaker B to the bus stop after practice finished, but another person was going to the same bus stop. Speaker B could tell he wanted to talk, but because of the other person, he couldn’t. Speaker B did not think much of it, believing that if it was important, he could text them.\n\nThe next day, Speaker B was watching some videos about the dance movement they tried during practice and sent them to him. He then replied with a huge paragraph saying he was now back with that lady and that they could still dance together. He also mentioned that the lady actually knew Speaker B and thought they would be a good dancer. Speaker B felt beyond confused and suspected he was lying about something.

Speaker B and Speaker A are supposed to be reconciling and working on themselves and their relationship. All Speaker B reads is more manipulation, defensiveness, and gaslighting.\n\nSpeaker B and Speaker A have been trying to reconcile after a horrible split back in May. Speaker B won’t provide all the details of this but to summarize, they were married, and Speaker A pretty much upended their lives when he separated their joint bank account. This occurred after Speaker B inquired about something Speaker A was doing. Speaker A immediately became defensive and then spiraled out of control, disrupting their lives.\n\nSince that time, Speaker A has moved out, gotten his own place and vehicle, and has been attempting to figure his life out. They agreed several months ago that they still loved one another and wanted to make it work, but that Speaker A would live on his own for a year, after which they would decide about him moving back in.\n\nThey still are not in a healthy place, but last night, after spending the last three days together, Speaker A went out to dinner with his roommate. After dinner, he was supposed to come over and collect some of his things that he needed for a trip the next morning.

Additionally, Speaker B mentioned that Speaker A had been kicked out of rehab for being sexually inappropriate with people there, despite having a wife and two kids at home. The list of issues seemed endless, and Speaker B felt compelled to write about it.\n\nSpeaker B expressed her feelings in a message:\n\n“Speaker B cannot help Speaker A and has said this multiple times. Speaker B is trying to be kind and look at things from Speaker A's perspective but has communicated everything that Speaker A needs to know. Speaker B is busy and cannot assist at this time, but believes Speaker A is capable and a strong woman and mother. Speaker B suggested that Speaker A take an Uber to AutoZone, emphasizing that she is not choosing someone else over Speaker A. Speaker B wants Speaker A to trust in her ability to take care of herself and has already acknowledged the need to fix her headlight. Speaker B understands that Speaker A is her mother, and nothing will change that. Speaker B loves Speaker A and sees her struggles and pain, but needs to take a step back. Speaker B cannot continue the current cycle as she is hurting and healing. Speaker B needs to prioritize her own well-being and is tired of feeling obligated to fix things for Speaker A simply because she is her mother. Speaker B feels bound to Speaker A by blood but believes their relationship has been harmed due to past issues not being properly addressed and a lack of accountability. Speaker B and her partner constantly worry about Speaker A. Speaker B recalls staying up at night, terrified that Speaker A might not be okay, feeling a lack of consistent evidence to the contrary. Speaker B's life has been completely shifted because of Speaker A's unwillingness to address her mental illness in a constructive way that does not involve her children. Speaker B is uncertain if Speaker A is ready to accept that she has hurt not only herself but also her entire family.\n\nSpeaker B clarified that her intention is not to shame Speaker A or make her feel unworthy of love. She is sharing this with the hope of healing and starting a new cycle with Speaker A, grounded in love, honesty, and kindness.\n\nSpeaker B wants a relationship with Speaker A and desires her to be her mother, but cannot continue in the current manner.\n\nSpeaker A had expressed, “I guess I’m a bad mother and you don’t love me,” which Speaker B internalized for years. Since childhood, Speaker B felt the need to “save” Speaker A.\n\nSpeaker B stated the facts: Speaker A abused her, her partner, and her ex-wife, and continues to abuse herself and her authority as Speaker B's mother. Speaker A uses her role as a mother as an excuse for Speaker B to help her with matters that do not involve her. Speaker A got herself into this mess and needs to find a way out. Speaker B cannot assist her. Speaker A has caused Speaker B pain, and she will have to relearn how to navigate life due to the consequences of Speaker A's actions. Speaker A held Speaker B's head underwater as a child while she and her sister were fighting, believing it was the right thing to do. Speaker B expressed disbelief at this behavior, stating that Speaker A choked and hit her and her sister. Speaker B believes Speaker A has no idea of the extent of the harm she has caused to their family due to her defensiveness and inability to confront the truth of the situation. Speaker B emphasized that Speaker A is her mother, not her equal, and she feels compelled to remind her of this. Speaker B does not owe Speaker A anything, especially since she has not been there for her when needed. While Speaker A was present for birthday parties and hospital visits, Speaker B feels she was also abused, both mentally and physically. Speaker B acknowledges that Speaker A is sick but still loves her. She believes Speaker A is a significant barrier in her life and has a right to be angry about it. Speaker B is furious and loves Speaker A, but her anger is profound. Speaker A has said things that Speaker B will never forget, which she has internalized and repressed. Speaker A is the main reason for Speaker B's addiction and pain, which goes deeper than the physical and current events. It relates to Speaker A's life and experiences. Speaker B believes Speaker A is in the process of creating generational trauma. While Speaker B understands that Speaker A's upbringing was likely traumatic and difficult, she believes Speaker A thinks she has “graduated therapy” or does not need it. Speaker B asserts that Speaker A needs help, not only as her mother but as a human being. Speaker B is expressing this because no one else will. Speaker A is sick and needs assistance. Speaker B believes Speaker A has the resources—money, friends, and family—but she cannot help her. If Speaker A does not seek help immediately, clean up her life, and get rid of her dog, Speaker B will pursue a restraining order against her. Speaker B knows Speaker A may think she is overreacting or that someone else is influencing her thoughts, but she has seen the facts and knows everything she needs to know about the situation. Speaker B has not been sane in years and has tried for nearly 21 years to help Speaker A. She moved in with her for a year, cleaned up her mess, and ended up in rehab and the psych ward, relapsing in the process. Despite this, Speaker A continues to ask for help. Speaker B appreciates Speaker A's attempts to mend their relationship with gifts, acknowledging that the comic-con tickets were thoughtful and that she enjoyed the experience. Speaker B recognizes Speaker A's love for her, but she also loves Speaker A in ways she may not fully understand. Speaker B urges Speaker A to seek help, stating that she cannot assist her. She expresses her love and emphasizes that if Speaker A contacts her partner to change her mind, it will only make the decision to file a restraining order easier. Speaker B acknowledges the difficulty of her decision, stating that it is the hardest thing she has ever done. She is currently crying and has experienced multiple panic attacks over the need for Speaker A to help herself and change for the better so that Speaker B can heal. If Speaker A truly loves and cares for Speaker B, she will respect her decision and seek help from a higher power or someone else, or else not have a relationship with Speaker B. Speaker B recommends that Speaker A join an AA group and work through the 12 steps, believing that Speaker A needs it. Speaker B feels that Speaker A is a “dry drunk” who has not genuinely recovered but has merely repressed and denied her issues for years. Speaker B encourages Speaker A to find a higher power other than herself and make amends. If Speaker B is working the steps at 20 years old, Speaker A can do the same if she wants the relationship she believes she deserves with Speaker B. Speaker B suggests that Speaker A find a sponsor, which is free, and start her healing journey for herself and her relationships. Ultimately, it is up to Speaker A to make this decision, and Speaker B urges her to choose wisely. She expresses her love and encourages Speaker A to take care of herself.\n\nSpeaker B states that if Speaker A tries to show up at her house, she will call the police. If Speaker A goes through her partner to contact her, Speaker B will seek a restraining order. If Speaker A attempts to use anyone or anything to see her, Speaker B will pursue a restraining order. At this moment, Speaker B cannot see Speaker A and does not feel safe with her mentally. She is triggered beyond repair and needs time to heal. Speaker B demands that Speaker A allow her the space she needs and refrain from hurting anyone that Speaker B loves, as Speaker A has done enough. Speaker B believes that healing cannot come from gifts and love; it requires facing issues head-on, apologizing, taking accountability, and actively trying to change. All Speaker B asks is for Speaker A to try. Speaker B has made efforts, including asking Speaker A to go to therapy, but Speaker A declined, leading Speaker B to feel done for now. She expresses her love and urges Speaker A to take care of herself.\n\nSpeaker B has personally contacted someone at Pro Hazard to assist Speaker A. His name is ******, and he needs Speaker A's permission to clean up her space. \n\nSpeaker A responded:\n\nShe believed she had taken full responsibility for her actions repeatedly. Speaker A stated that she cannot take responsibility for what she has not done and expressed concern that the more time Speaker B spends listening to others, the more injured she becomes with anger toward Speaker A.\n\nSpeaker A acknowledged that Speaker B was strong as a child and that when she would attack someone, Speaker A had to pull her off the best way she could. Speaker A described the situation as rough but not abusive, attributing Speaker B's behavior to rage caused by her misophonia. Speaker A claimed her goal was to seclude Speaker B to prevent injury to anyone. She mentioned that there are still holes in the door from Speaker B's rage and explained that it was a neurological disorder. Speaker A described how Speaker B would charge at her, hitting her hard, while Speaker A resisted. She insisted that it was not abuse from either of them but rather a physical and emotional response. Speaker A apologized if Speaker B recalls any hitting on her part during those times.\n\nSpeaker A acknowledged that Speaker B was traumatized by their forced separation when she was eight years old, stating", "c1_input": "Speaker A asked Speaker B for help after their car battery died, but Speaker B was unable to assist due to a tight schedule and lack of transportation.

Speaker A blocked Speaker B on Instagram after that and deleted Speaker B's number. Then two weeks ago, Speaker A randomly slid back into Speaker B's DMs and asked if they could catch up. Speaker A asked to go to a place within walking distance from Speaker B, and originally planned to pick Speaker B up on the way since it was raining. However, Speaker A switched it up when arriving and asked to park in Speaker B's building and walk since the rain had stopped.\n\nDuring the “catch up,” Speaker A asked if they could consider it a date. Speaker B responded with something like “I guess it can be” but made it very clear verbally that they weren’t dating anyone at that moment and weren’t in the headspace for dating. Speaker B explained that if they were to date, it would need to be very slow since they had just been enjoying life, traveling, and seeing friends. For the rest of the date, Speaker A seemed to ignore this and kept expressing how glad they were that “they were on a date,” and referenced being excited to keep getting to know each other. What made it feel weirder was that Speaker B found out Speaker A had been in a relationship a few weeks earlier, which made it seem like Speaker A was overly eager given they were just dating someone else.\n\nAt one point, Speaker B apologized for backing away the year prior, and Speaker A responded, “that really hurt me….” This reaction felt strange and a bit victim-y to Speaker B, considering they had only gone on two or three dates total. It set a weird tone, making Speaker B feel somewhat guilty. Speaker B apologized again sincerely since Speaker A seemed sad about it for some reason.\n\nAfter dinner and drinks (around almost midnight), Speaker B said they were tired and it was time to head back, so they went back to Speaker B's floor where Speaker A had parked. Speaker A started saying what Speaker B thought were goodbyes. However, Speaker B realized once they buzzed into the gate and heard footsteps behind them that Speaker A had followed them into the building without asking. Speaker A acknowledged this by saying, “wait, why Is Speaker B following you?” Speaker B replied, “I have no idea… 👀,” adding a laugh to cut the tension. Speaker A then asked to come inside for “a few minutes.”\n\nSpeaker B sat as far away as possible on the couch and yawned a bit to signal that Speaker A should leave. About 30 minutes in, Speaker A said, “I really want to kiss you” and stared. Speaker B agreed and kissed Speaker A for five seconds, but it felt so strange that Speaker B pulled away and immediately said, “text me when you make it home,” staring intensely with no emotion until Speaker A left.\n\nDoubt kicked in for Speaker B, and they texted Speaker A again the next day. After that, Speaker A started acting like a boyfriend, asking to pick Speaker B up from the airport and engaging in overly familiar behaviors given they had only been on one date.

{"id": "1ln5m66", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B (26F) has been best friends with Speaker A (32F) for 12 years. They met online through writing forums and have spent over the last decade writing together. They had dreams of publishing together and engaged in extensive, Game of Thrones-level world-building, plots, and characters. Speaker B considered Speaker A a sister, and given that Speaker B barely talks to their birth family, Speaker A was the most important person in Speaker B's life until Speaker B met their wife four years ago. Speaker B even moved cross-country from the Midwest to the East Coast when they were 19 to live with Speaker A, although they had to move back to the Midwest three years ago due to financial reasons.\n\nSpeaker B was the maid of honor at Speaker A's wedding. Speaker B feels like they put their heart and soul into their friendship and admits to having had significant codependency issues with Speaker A for a considerable part of their friendship. However, for at least the entire second half of their friendship, it has felt very unbalanced to Speaker B, sometimes because Speaker B tends to invest too much in relationships, perhaps to a degree that was unfair to expect in return. When friends have problems, Speaker B will drop everything to help them, wanting them to be successful and happy. Speaker B felt they did not receive that same level of support in return.\n\nMore recent information: Speaker A had twin boys two and a half years ago, just a couple of months after Speaker B had to move back home. Speaker B was devastated not to be there, as they had talked extensively about how they would be involved in the boys' lives. Speaker B is their godmother and had discussed providing free or cheap childcare. Speaker B was very close to flying over, ignoring all job responsibilities, to be with Speaker A when she gave birth and when the boys had to be in the NICU due to being premature. The only real reason Speaker B did not go was that their wife was already out of town for a funeral, and one of their dogs has aggression issues that made boarding or finding last-minute dog sitters impossible. However, Speaker B did fly over for almost a full month nearly two months after the boys were born to help care for them—doing overnights, feeding them, changing diapers, babysitting, and anything else they could to assist.\n\nSince then, Speaker B has visited. Notably, in their entire friendship, Speaker A has never visited Speaker B. Speaker B visited Speaker A twice as a teenager before moving closer to her and a couple of times after moving.\n\nThe crux of the issue: Speaker B gave birth earlier this month. Their baby was incredibly premature, at only 22 weeks gestation. Speaker B texted Speaker A while in the hospital to explain what was happening, that they were being discharged, and that their baby had been transferred to a level 4 NICU. Speaker B followed their baby to the secondary hospital only a few hours after birth and operated on basically no sleep while their baby fought for her life. After 24 hours of a lot of hecticness, Speaker B noticed that Speaker A had never responded and did not check up on them. Meanwhile, Speaker B's wife had her sister checking up on her, and a local friend had come to the hospital to visit. Speaker B was furious and upset—probably due to lack of sleep, but also because they had always felt that Speaker A did not show up for them during difficult times, as Speaker A always seemed to have harder problems, and Speaker B often had to set aside their feelings to make Speaker A feel better. Speaker B thought that surely, with their baby fighting for her life and having gone through a very traumatic birth, this situation would finally warrant Speaker A's attention. Then, 44 hours after the baby was born, she passed away. Speaker B posted on Facebook to announce this later that day. Speaker A left a heart and sent an extremely basic condolence message. Speaker B admits they did not respond, feeling they had a good excuse for being busy.\n\nSpeaker B did not hear back from Speaker A again for two weeks. There was no check-up or contact. After just a couple of days, Speaker B was already angry and was waiting to see how long it would take Speaker A to reach out. Then, two days ago, Speaker A sent a message claiming to be supportive and stating that she was there for Speaker B. Speaker B was again angry because they knew how ineffective Speaker A's support was at this point.\n\nSpeaker B included screenshots of their entire text conversation from the moment Speaker A found out about the baby’s death to Speaker B's message. Speaker B feels lost, already grieving their daughter, and is devastated at the thought of possibly losing their best friend as well over this situation.

She explains that this is a burner account since Dylan and their friends all use Reddit and have access to her main account.\n\nSpeaker B, an 18-year-old female, is engaged to her fiancé, a 26-year-old male named Dylan. They have been dating for two years, and he recently proposed on her birthday in June, which was a sweet moment shared with both of their families and friends, making it the best birthday present she could have asked for. Speaker B still gets butterflies thinking about that day. Fast forward to September, school has recently started in her state, and Dylan works as a teacher at her old high school, where he was a teaching assistant when she was a student. Since summer break is over, he leaves earlier in the mornings before she wakes up, which doesn’t bother her. School starts at 7:05 am, so he needs to be there by at least 6:25 am, typically leaving around 6:00 am to avoid traffic. Speaker B has gotten used to waking up without him being there, but she has decided to start waking up earlier to surprise him with breakfast, like a toasted bagel with egg, ham, and cheese, along with coffee. Since Dylan pays for the bills in his own home, she feels it’s the least she can do to make breakfast when he leaves and prepare dinner when he comes home, although she lives with her parents and isn’t at his house all the time.\n\nYesterday, Speaker B woke up around 5:00 am to make him breakfast, as she usually does when she has time. However, when she went downstairs, she found him already sitting on the couch putting on his shoes, which confused her because he usually wakes up around that time too. She asked Dylan why he was dressed so early, and he seemed startled to see her. He explained that he had to go in early to fill in for another teacher who was going to be absent that day. Speaker B was confused and asked why they couldn’t just get a substitute teacher and who would fill in for his own class. Dylan said the school would take care of it but that he needed to leave earlier to “prepare” for it. When she asked about breakfast, he told her he would just stop at a gas station to grab something quick on the way. Speaker B was so sleepy that she didn’t remember much else he said because he kissed her forehead, and before she opened her eyes again, he was out the door. Confused, she went back to sleep. Later, when she woke up again, she thought about why he couldn’t just leave at his usual time if he needed to be a substitute and why the school couldn’t get a substitute to cover that class. Having attended that school since middle school in 2018, she knew they had a regular set of substitute teachers, and it was rare for a teacher to cover another teacher’s class.\n\nSpeaker B felt upset with herself for not bringing this up earlier in their text messages, as she was emotional and not thinking clearly at the time. For context, “Lauren,” a 24-year-old female, is Dylan’s ex-girlfriend. They dated for seven years from 2015 to 2021, meaning they were already together before she moved to their state in 2017, and Lauren is also a family friend. Dylan stated that the lockdown during the pandemic made them realize they were incompatible, and they split on good terms in 2021, just two years before he asked Speaker B out. Dylan, Lauren, and their two other friends, Anna, a 25-year-old female, and Anna’s husband, Josh, a 28-year-old male, are all in the same friend group, which Speaker B believes is relevant.\n\nOn the same day Dylan left super early, Lauren invited them over to her place to watch a movie in the afternoon. While there, Speaker B experienced intense pre-period cramps, and Lauren suggested she go into her bedroom and the bathroom to take some ibuprofen. While in the bedroom, Speaker B noticed something familiar on the dresser—Dylan’s glasses. He had left the house that morning wearing them, and she recognized them as his. Unsure of what to do, she grabbed the glasses, took the ibuprofen, and headed downstairs. She asked Lauren why Dylan’s glasses were on her dresser, and Lauren, Anna, and Josh all fell silent, which threw Speaker B off. \n\nLauren shrugged and told Speaker B to return the glasses to Dylan if she went to his house. Speaker B looked at Anna and Josh, confused by their silence and their refusal to look at her when Lauren casually mentioned to Anna, not her, that Dylan had to come by to pick up something, and all three of them agreed, which felt strange. Normally, Speaker B wouldn’t have cared if Dylan went over to Lauren’s place because he is an adult and can do what he wants, and they are all friends with Lauren. However, finding his glasses on the dresser beside Lauren’s bed felt odd, and the way her friends reacted when she brought it up felt weird. She ended up going home early because she didn’t feel well and called Dylan to ask why he left his glasses there and why he lied about where he was going. She would have been fine with him going; she just didn’t understand why he had to lie and not tell her. Dylan responded that he “didn’t need this from her right now” and hung up, which made Speaker B burst into tears because he had never hung up on her before. This led to a tense text exchange between them. Speaker B is currently at her parents’ house instead of Dylan’s because he is refusing to speak to her about this situation. He feels upset that she would accuse him of something like this, and their friends are siding with him. Anna reached out to Speaker B, calling her to say that she understands this is her first relationship, but she can’t just accuse the person she is going to marry of cheating. Josh agreed, stating that she was being childish and acting immaturely. Dylan echoed the same sentiment, and Lauren is refusing to speak to Speaker B because she is hurt that Speaker B would think she would do something behind her back. They all believe Speaker B is being childish and overreacting over nothing, but she is unsure.

{"id": "1h78cw2", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B is reflecting on a situation involving a text that Speaker A sent. Firstly, this came out of nowhere. When Speaker A started talking about how Speaker B is immature, Speaker B wasn’t sure what to do, so Speaker B just reiterated what they are doing with their life.\n\nSpeaker B is working full-time and pursuing an MBA, albeit online.\n\nFor context, Speaker B and Speaker A started dating under romantic circumstances; Speaker A is not a sugar daddy. Speaker A looks really young, so Speaker B was truly shocked to learn his age. Now, Speaker B sees it as a mistake, so they do not want to be heckled for this.\n\nSpeaker A is older than Speaker B by 20 years. Speaker B is 25, and Speaker A is 45. Speaker A owns a restaurant, and Speaker B does remote admin work at a small startup.\n\nAfter dating for just under a year, Speaker A asked Speaker B to move in with him, as Speaker B was stressing about a recent rent increase. Speaker B could pay it, but it wrecked their financial planning and was miserable. Speaker B was looking for an out, as their rent went from $1850 to $2300, not including utilities.\n\nSpeaker A owns his house, so he told Speaker B they could live with him if they wanted. He said that Speaker B could live there and save up money, and that they could leave whenever they wanted, with no pressure. He invited Speaker B; Speaker B did not ask nor imply they wanted to move in.\n\nSpeaker B agreed (which they now consider a horrible mistake). They moved in, and now they are in this situation. Speaker A doesn’t make Speaker B cover any utilities or charge rent, which Speaker B thought was kind of him.\n\nSpeaker B uses their work phone for work but is usually lying down. When they have a meeting, they sit up and answer the call. Speaker B is a solid employee, just doing backup admin work. The pay is nice; they can’t complain.\n\nSpeaker A started saying that Speaker B needs to step it up in life after seeing them ‘leisurely working.’ Speaker B chose this job because they worked on their feet since high school, during their undergrad, and a bit of their current MBA. They wanted to pivot to a more relaxed job. Speaker B chose this job because it is leisurely. They are working from 9 am to about 5 pm, whereas Speaker A works from 5 pm to 5 am. So, from Speaker A’s perspective, Speaker B is often asleep or unavailable.\n\nToday, Speaker A walked downstairs to work and saw Speaker B sitting on the couch. Speaker B has told him many times that they are working via their phone. Speaker A doesn’t seem to understand that and makes weird little jabs.\n\nThen, Speaker A sent Speaker B these messages.\n\nSpeaker B felt really annoyed because Speaker A implied that they are not interested in self-improvement, that they are immature, and that they are arrogant, while denying that it’s hurtful to say such things.\n\nBy the final slide, Speaker B decided to call their mom, who they felt could offer insight. Speaker B’s mom is 40 years older than them but understands technology. She said it seems like Speaker A is trying to play some kind of game and suggested that Speaker B should just ask him why he’s asking all this now. Speaker B agreed that Speaker A seems to be beating around the bush.\n\nSo, Speaker B decided to ask Speaker A why he is treating them like this.\n\nWhen Speaker A said he’s talking to Speaker B like an adult, outside of text, Speaker B exploded inside. Immediately, they felt so angry.\n\nSpeaker A invites Speaker B to live with him, then holds it over them. He calls Speaker B all sorts of things over text but then denies that he is saying such things. He can’t just say what he means. He then doubles down and says he’s just worried about Speaker B’s maturity.\n\nBecause of this, and a conversation they had afterward where Speaker A ignored all of Speaker B’s concerns, didn’t let them speak, and bulldozed the entire way, Speaker B has decided to move out and find their own place again. Speaker A just has zero emotional intelligence. His ex-girlfriend was 50, the other one 55, and his ex-wife was his same age. Speaker B thought that meant he wouldn’t be acting like this in the typical way that men who date younger women do, but they were so wrong. Speaker A has been talking to Speaker B like they are a child, and Speaker B feels they have no ground to stand on with him. They can’t take it.\n\nSpeaker A is saying that moving out over this is crazy, not based in reality, and that Speaker B is losing a really good chance at stability. He loves Speaker B and says they shouldn’t go because if they do, they’ll just have to go back to paying crazy rent.

{"id": "1jrix9l", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "A situation arose for Speaker B, a 19-year-old female, regarding her 20-year-old female roommate, referred to as Speaker A, who Speaker B believes is being unreasonable.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nSpeaker B and Speaker A met during their first year of college the previous year. Speaker B's scheduled roommate never showed up, leaving her with the room to herself. By the spring semester, the college informed them that they needed to either buy out the room or find a new roommate. Speaker B and Speaker A agreed to room together after Speaker A's previous roommate moved out due to a falling out. However, during room selection, Speaker A informed Speaker B that she had chosen to room with someone else because she thought Speaker B would buy out the room. Speaker B had never stated that she would do so; she had only mentioned that her mom suggested it, but they had ultimately decided it was too expensive and not worth it. Consequently, Speaker B ended up rooming with another student, referred to as E, for the spring.\n\nOver the summer, all three of them—Speaker B, Speaker A, and E—agreed to room in a triple for the current year. However, E left college at the end of the last semester, so Speaker B and Speaker A remained in the triple together without incurring extra costs or buyouts. Speaker A had always been somewhat uptight and a neat freak, while Speaker B was generally agreeable and preferred to accommodate others to avoid conflict. E often acted as a mediator between Speaker B and Speaker A whenever Speaker A became upset about the room's messiness. Speaker A would also express frustration towards E for having a messy desk, clothes on the floor, and mismatched shoes.\n\nSince E's departure, Speaker A's behavior has worsened. Although both Speaker B and Speaker A are rarely in the room due to classes, practice, work, or visiting their boyfriends, Speaker B spends more time in the room than Speaker A. Speaker B cannot recall the last time Speaker A slept in the room or spent more than 30 minutes there. Speaker A frequently claims that Speaker B is never around and complains about the messes Speaker B leaves. While Speaker B acknowledges that she is messier, she cleans up after herself and keeps her messes confined to her personal areas. Speaker A has even boxed Speaker B in by taping a square around the corner where Speaker B's desk and closet are located, insisting that Speaker B cannot have a mess outside that area and constantly complains when anything touches the tape.\n\nOne night, Speaker B's boyfriend, referred to as J, was visiting, and Speaker A entered to pick up some items before heading to her boyfriend's house. Speaker B and J were playing Xbox and eating, leaving a bag and wrappers in front of them. Speaker A immediately complained, saying, \"you need to make sure you clean up that mess,\" using a condescending, passive-aggressive tone.\n\nSTORY:\n\nSpeaker B stayed with J for two weeks after spring break because her car broke down at home in Virginia, and her keychain, which contained her dorm key and campus ID, was inaccessible. When she finally returned last Thursday, Speaker B invited a couple of friends over for game night after their night class, an event she had invited Speaker A to multiple times, but Speaker A always had an excuse not to attend. They played drinking games in their room while Speaker A was absent, and Speaker B informed her about the gathering. The following morning, Speaker A inquired if Speaker B had seen her goose, why items on her desk were moved, and how things got out of her desk drawer. The texts reiterated that Speaker B had not touched Speaker A's belongings; the only item Speaker B moved that night was a black knit book, which she repositioned to prevent it from falling.\n\nOne friend left while Speaker B was still awake, as she lived in her van, while another friend had passed out an hour earlier, and Speaker B had covered her with a blanket. Speaker B cleaned up as best as she could, as it was the first time she had been genuinely drunk, and packed the last friend's bag to alleviate her worries about the morning. There were a couple of spills of Capri Sun and Fireball throughout the night, but they were cleaned up immediately. Speaker A sent texts complaining about the room being sticky, and Speaker B assured her that she would re-clean the entire area.\n\nE and Speaker B had scheduled a visit from Friday to Sunday, which Speaker B informed Speaker A about 1-2 weeks in advance. However, a few days before E's arrival, Speaker A announced that she had a recruit for her sport coming to visit from Friday to Saturday. Speaker A lectured Speaker B about not drinking, smoking, cursing, or making jokes around the recruit, stating, \"she's just a junior.\" Speaker B agreed and hid everything, despite finding it unreasonable to treat a 16/17-year-old like a child who would report inappropriate behavior. Speaker B reiterated that E would be there the entire weekend starting Friday, but Speaker A then mentioned that her mom would be visiting from Saturday to Sunday. Speaker B assured Speaker A that as long as the recruit and her mom were not both present by the time they went to sleep, there would be no issue. Speaker B offered to take the floor, allowing the recruit and Speaker A's mom to occupy the third bed while E could have Speaker B's bed.\n\nE arrived on Friday, and they hung out until the recruit came, at which point Speaker A immediately lectured both of them again. While Speaker B was on FaceTime with J, Speaker A insisted that she hang up, stating, \"I don’t want him to make the recruit uncomfortable.\" Speaker B explained that they were not even talking, but Speaker A insisted, leading Speaker B to back down and end the call. By 9 PM, Speaker A was already saying that she and the recruit needed to sleep, which meant that E and Speaker B also had to sleep. Speaker B takes her Lexapro at 9 PM and Temazepam approximately 30 minutes before bed, but she could not find her medication.\n\nAs Speaker B searched for her meds, Speaker A turned off all the lights. Speaker B suggested turning on her LED lights, which are phone-controlled, since Speaker A had turned on her desk light, which was excessively bright. Speaker A agreed but kept her desk light on, so Speaker B plugged in her LEDs. Shortly after, Speaker A unplugged Speaker B's LEDs, claiming she \"doesn't like it dangling above the bed,\" despite Speaker B having secured the wires against the wall and her bunk's springs.\n\nSpeaker A continued to rush Speaker B and eventually pressured her to give up searching for her medication. Feeling overwhelmed, Speaker B climbed into her bed and began to have a breakdown, prompting her to text J, who eventually encouraged her to come over. Speaker B felt guilty about leaving E, who woke up as she was leaving around 11 PM and asked where she was going. Speaker B expressed, \"I’m sad,\" and E understood. Speaker B offered her bed to E again, but E declined, stating she did not want to risk falling off the top bunk.\n\nThe next day, Speaker B returned, and E informed her that Speaker A had canceled her mom's visit because \"something came up.\" Speaker B accepted this as Speaker A's choice. J invited Speaker B to a baseball game on Sunday, and E encouraged her to go since she wanted to spend time with other friends before leaving. Speaker B found her medication and was able to sleep in the dorm with E while Speaker A was at her boyfriend's house. The following day, Speaker B left for the game, and Speaker A returned while she was away, noticing E in the room (refer to the texts where Speaker A claimed Speaker B was \"MIA\").\n\nThroughout E's visit, Speaker A continued to complain about the recruit potentially feeling uncomfortable, as if that would not be the case if E had remained in the room this semester, and she was cold and dismissive towards E. E began to feel uncomfortable, and they discussed it, agreeing that Speaker A was being unreasonable.\n\nA couple of nights ago, as Speaker B was going to bed, she heard a shattering sound. She turned over to see shiny pieces on the floor and quickly got up to clean it up. She texted Speaker A to inform her that her turtle had broken and then fell asleep. Throughout the day, Speaker A sent several texts. The picture of Speaker A's desk was taken from Speaker B's bed, showing it cluttered with breakable items at the edge, which Speaker B often pushed back to prevent anything from falling. The only three pieces of the turtle that were salvageable were the rest was shards and practically dust. Speaker B ended up with holes in her foot from cleaning up the mess.\n\nIn summary, Speaker B feels that Speaker A constantly complains about her mess, has boxed her into a limited space, believes Speaker B broke her trinkets despite her innocence, and portrays Speaker B as a bad person.", "c1_input": "Speaker B informed Speaker A that their turtle had died, which upset Speaker A as they believed it was a glass turtle that held sentimental value.

{"id": "1nnhhwh", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B's (M27) girlfriend (F27) told Speaker B that he was overreacting about her male friend sending money to her behind his back.\n\nSpeaker B provided a quick summary of what happened before this, in short detail.\n\nAs they were coming off the tail of previous tension and making up, Speaker B told his girlfriend that he had two hard boundaries: that he was very uncomfortable with his partner bringing their friends into their relationship details in the middle of their arguments, and that he was very uncomfortable with the idea of another man sending money or buying things for his partner. To Speaker B, these things were very reasonable to ask of a partner, and he believed she was on board with this prior, as he had asked these things of her before and she had respected them up to that point.\n\nThough this time, she told Speaker B that she wasn’t sure she agreed with these boundaries and needed to think about it. He told her that these were very important to him, and he was not comfortable continuing things if she could not respect him at the most basic level. She offered to sleep in the other room, and he agreed it was for the best right now to give them space to think.\n\nFast forward a couple of days, Speaker B woke up to her sheepishly asking to lay in bed with him. She told him she had been feeling sick, most likely because she had a day of missed antidepressants, lack of food, and an unexpected reaction with other recent medication. After acting nice to him, she asked him directly if he could take her back up to McDonald’s to get her a cheeseburger and a sweet tea. She had asked him to do this the day prior, and he drove her up to use her points because he wanted her to feel better and loved her regardless of their fighting. However, lately, his finances had been increasingly strained, as he had been supporting them both entirely with bills, medication, food, transportation, and fun things for them to share. She had been staying at his house for eight months unemployed, smoking weed while he had been providing and looking out for her every need.\n\nIn response to her asking him for more McDonald’s, Speaker B shared that finances were extremely low for him right now and that he would feel more comfortable if she’d try to use her points again or make something at home instead. But she told him the only thing she was craving was a cheeseburger and sweet tea and could not eat anything else without getting sick from her medication-induced nausea. She then directly asked him if a friend, let’s call him A, could cover her meal with his points instead. The previous tension they had been working through revolved around A, so Speaker B told her that he did not feel comfortable with that and that it could be something to discuss at a later time. She then sat silently for a moment without responding.\n\nSome quick backstory about A: he was a married man who had been constantly offering to cover various things for Speaker B's girlfriend, such as offering to buy any desk she chose on Amazon, no questions asked. Before that, this man had blocked her on Discord because he had trash-talked his wife to Speaker B's girlfriend in her DMs, so it was assumed his wife made him block her for two years. It wasn’t until recently that he randomly unblocked her and began talking to her throughout the day, even into the early mornings between 2-6 am while Speaker B was sleeping. There was even a point when she was speaking to him daily much more than to Speaker B for a few weeks straight. Speaker B voiced his discomfort with him constantly wanting to send her money and how much attention she gave another man while ignoring her boyfriend. He thought that she had set this boundary with him and agreed to respect their relationship.\n\nSo flash forward to now. Speaker B's girlfriend then told him she’d start “looking through her accounts to see if she had any money laying around,” then went to the bathroom with her phone. When she returned, she had a story lined up about how she “found $5 randomly on Robinhood and transferred it immediately to her PayPal.” This didn’t add up to Speaker B, since he knew there was no direct transfer from Robinhood to PayPal. He mentioned this in passing, and she stuttered a bit uncomfortably and dropped it. The drive to McDonald’s was very awkward and quiet, and he figured something was up.\n\nBefore they got home, Speaker B directly asked his girlfriend if she would ever lie to him about small things like this. She then immediately confessed to lying to his face, as her friend had indeed covered the meal, and she used the funds left over from his previous PayPal sends to fund the sweet tea. She later informed him that he had been sending her money for various things for at least a couple of weeks before this, all without his knowledge or comfort even being considered. She even had the audacity to say that him not getting her the McDonald’s cheeseburger and tea was showing her he “didn’t care about what she was going through” and that she was “suffering” because of it, and that was why it was okay to lie to him about her friend sending her money without his knowledge. She said it was out of necessity, but as she admitted before, he had been sending her money for other things weeks before. She refused to tell him what exactly he was buying her, which Speaker B felt told him all he needed to know.\n\nAfter hearing this, Speaker B honestly felt hurt and betrayed. He felt disposable because he was uncomfortable giving his girlfriend money he did not have at the time. So he simply told her he would no longer be providing anything for her and locked himself in his room. They had a blowout of yelling between them for a few minutes shortly after, which he honestly regretted and has since apologized for. But the above screenshots are from his (ex?) girlfriend regarding the situation, saying that he was not experienced enough to know that his expectations were irrational. Speaker B agreed that he should find someone who respects these boundaries, but he felt that these were rather tame requests he had for her, and it was shocking that she couldn’t care about him at a basic level to agree to them.\n\nSpeaker B loved his (ex?) girlfriend, and it pained him that she betrayed his trust like this, even over something as trivial as a cheeseburger. But he genuinely worried that if she was okay with lying to him over something so small, then what would she be okay with lying to him about in the future if he stayed with her?\n\nIn summary, Speaker B questioned whether it was really that uncommon for boyfriends to ask their girlfriends not to have their guy friends spoil them with money or goods, and to avoid trash-talking their boyfriends to their friends (especially other men). He wondered if these things were rather common requests between partners.\n\nAdditionally, Speaker B wanted to clarify that he thought sending friends gifts on holidays, special occasions, birthdays, or normal types of friendly gestures was perfectly normal and he wouldn’t have a problem with that. He just found it unacceptable that she was constantly offered money, lied about receiving money for at least two weeks from a married man behind his back, and shared all of their relationship conflict details while bad-mouthing him.", "c1_input": "Speaker A expressed feelings of hopelessness and a desire to end the relationship, emphasizing the need for change and compromise from Speaker B.

Subsequently, Speaker B received text messages from the group leader, who first sent a voice message detailing requests to \"remove shadows from the video, change certain dresses from a patterned design to a plain white design, make the audio clearer,\" and more.\n\nAt 17 years old, Speaker B has only basic experience with Adobe Premiere Pro and is fully self-taught. They take pride in their skill level, especially when they have a clear vision, but the tasks listed by the group leader seemed well beyond basic skills.

They have been together for 3 years and share a large number of mutual friends on Facebook. The city they live in has a close-knit service industry, and most people know each other. Speaker B has worked at several of the most popular bars in the city, and Speaker A goes out frequently. Therefore, it has never bothered Speaker B that they have many mutual Facebook friends. However, Speaker A has a history of drunkenly cheating on Speaker B, an issue they have moved on from.

Upon clicking on her page, Speaker B discovered that she works at a local bar as well and recognized her from previous visits.

{"id": "1lwfx8v", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B is a 40-year-old male on a road trip on the east coast with Speaker A, a 12-year-old male child. They are parked at a campground in the middle of upstate New York at 10:30 PM, sitting in the front seat of a rental van just about to settle down for the night. Speaker B hears the phone ringing and sees that it’s a friend he hasn’t heard from in a long time. He hasn’t seen this friend, whom he will refer to as Peter, in over 20 years, and they talk maybe once every three years. Their conversations typically revolve around reminiscing about their high school days, and honestly, Speaker B doesn’t know much about Peter’s current life, nor does Peter know much about Speaker B’s. Peter was one of two good friends with whom Speaker B spent a lot of time during the first couple of years of high school, but he was 5-6 years older and had already graduated. To this day, Speaker B and the other friend do not know Peter’s real first name, as they have always called him by a nickname.\n\nSpeaker B answers the phone and can hear that Peter is in a bad place. Peter still lives in the Midwest in the same exact house where they used to get high together. His wife is pregnant, and he didn’t want another child, but she did after experiencing many miscarriages. Their other child is the same age as Speaker B's. Peter hasn’t worked in seven months and is seriously in debt, putting everything on credit cards, as he claims, and is two months behind on his mortgage. The call lasts an hour, during which Speaker B talks Peter down from suicidal thoughts and feels he has given him hope to find a job or something similar. Peter explains that his wife has no idea he isn’t working or that they are hundreds of thousands in debt. He feels he cannot tell her because it would stress her out and might lead to another miscarriage. Speaker B offers to help in whatever way he can, not financially, but by at least pointing Peter in the right direction. The call ends on a more positive note.\n\nThe next day, Peter calls Speaker B a couple of times and apologizes but feels he must ask to borrow $15,000. He claims that a loan shark is after him, threatening his house and family, and he is desperate. Speaker B says he will see what he can do but wants to see Peter’s financial documents, including mortgage stubs, credit card statements, and bank statements. Peter becomes a little quiet and then reveals that he doesn’t have a mortgage because his parents paid off the house a long time ago. Speaker B thinks this makes sense, but during their last call, Peter had mentioned being two months behind on his mortgage. When Speaker B asks for clarification, Peter explains that what he meant by mortgage is the $700 a month he pays his parents. Speaker B feels irritated because he had repeatedly told Peter that he needs to pay his mortgage to avoid losing his house, and Peter never clarified this point.\n\nFeeling that Peter may be dishonest, Speaker B decides to contact their other friend, whom he has remained in better contact with and has seen about ten times in the last 20 years. He refers to this friend as Johnny. Speaker B reaches out to Johnny and asks if he has talked to Peter lately. Johnny mentions that they spoke just a few days prior, and Peter had been asking a lot of questions about work, how much Johnny gets paid, and what else is new in life. Johnny was unaware that Peter’s wife was pregnant or that Peter was having any issues. They had a normal conversation, and then Peter started asking questions about Speaker B. Johnny, knowing that Speaker B owns his own business and moved to the West Coast years ago, tells Peter about the success Speaker B has been having.\n\nAfter hearing this from Johnny, Speaker B feels very unsettled. He is unsure what to believe from Peter or if any of it is true. Johnny and Speaker B joke that they have Peter saved in their phones under the same name and that they do not know his real name. They also joke that Peter is like a ninja; despite spending so much time together when they were younger, they never really knew anything about him.\n\nPeter then sends a series of messages, and Speaker B becomes increasingly frustrated. Peter keeps calling one after the other without leaving a voicemail, and the whole situation feels very off. \n\nIn summary, Speaker B's old secretive friend calls after 20 years asking to borrow $15,000 but is not being honest with his wife or Speaker B.

{"id": "1on3ehl", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B's friends are fighting, and Speaker B has no idea what to do.\n\nSpeaker B (15F) has two friends, Layla (15 almost 16F) and Miranda (16F), who are having a total falling out, and Speaker B has been put in the middle. Last year, during Speaker B's freshman year of high school, Speaker B got really close with Layla, considering her one of Speaker B's best friends. They had a small, close-knit friend group that included Miranda. Both Miranda and Layla eventually developed feelings for each other, and Speaker B was the only one who knew about their relationship.\n\nWithin their relationship, Layla would often come to Speaker B, complaining about Miranda and expressing that she felt Miranda wasn’t putting enough commitment into their relationship. Fast forward about 5 or 6 months, Layla told Speaker B that she broke up with Miranda for these reasons. Layla said they agreed to stay friends and not let their breakup affect their friend group.\n\nNow it’s homecoming. Layla and Speaker B are in a homecoming group with a few friends (without Miranda) and are planning to go to an afterparty at a girl named Lauren’s house. Once they arrive at the dance, Speaker B greets Miranda because they are close friends and have interconnecting friend groups. Speaker B asks Miranda if she’s going to Lauren’s afterparty, to which Miranda replies yes.\n\nFor the rest of the night, Speaker B hangs out with a girl named Anna. They both notice how distant Layla is being, as she avoids them the entire night. When it’s time to leave, Layla is very disrespectful towards their host, Lauren, saying things like, “Lauren, when the fuck are your parents going to be here?” and walking off without telling anyone where she’s going.\n\nWhen they return to Lauren’s house, Layla acts really weird and starts meditating on the floor of Lauren’s bedroom, which seems like it was supposed to be humorous, so everyone leaves her alone for a bit and goes outside. Speaker B and Miranda go back into the bedroom to see if Layla wants to talk about what’s wrong, and Layla completely flips out on them. She screams, “Get the fuck out before I get even more fucking angry.” Speaker B and Miranda share a look and then go to find an area to debrief.\n\nAfter Layla freaks out on them, she goes to the rest of the group and starts acting completely normal with them, singling out Speaker B, Miranda, and Anna for the entire night. There is so much tension that it feels like they can’t talk to the rest of the people there. They make the best of their situation until it’s time to leave the next morning.\n\nThe next day, Layla calls Speaker B to try and talk about everything. Layla says that Speaker B and Miranda should have known she was upset because Miranda came to the afterparty, and they were the only ones who knew the whole story. Layla expresses that she’s been mad because she thinks Miranda was trying to make things go back to normal too quickly and was touching Layla too much (Miranda is a naturally touchy person). Speaker B thinks it was nothing out of the ordinary for how they usually interacted, but acknowledges that Speaker B wasn’t in the relationship, so they don’t know. Speaker B reassures Layla that everything will be okay and that Speaker B will give her time to resolve her feelings with Miranda.\n\nOne day after school, while walking to the gas station together, Layla tells Speaker B that she and Miranda are fine and that she has resolved her negative feelings. Speaker B feels really happy that things are going okay again, until they aren’t.\n\nDuring Halloweekend, Speaker B's parents are going to give Speaker B and Layla a ride to the party at Lauren’s, as long as Layla’s parent can pick them up and take Speaker B back home. Miranda asks Speaker B if their parents can also take her to the party, so Speaker B first asks Layla to make sure it’s okay. Layla says it’s fine and thanks Speaker B for asking her.\n\nOn the day of the party, they pick up Layla, and everything is fine. Then they pick up Miranda, and suddenly Layla goes nonverbal for the rest of the car ride, which is weird. They arrive, and Layla storms up to the door without waiting for Speaker B and Miranda. Speaker B and Miranda sneak a bit of alcohol into the party, and while they both drink some, it’s clear that Miranda has had more than Speaker B. Layla doesn’t talk to either of them the entire party. She takes Speaker B into Lauren’s room and shoves a trash bag in Speaker B's face, saying something about how she’ll be super pissed if Miranda pukes in her car (which is valid) and that she’s disappointed. After they drop Miranda off, when Miranda is getting out of the car, Layla turns to Speaker B and says, “You gonna walk her to the door?” which feels petty but whatever.

He immediately suggested meeting for drinks and shared videos of drug use. Speaker B hasn't responded yet.\n\nSpeaker B, a 32-year-old man born and raised in NYC, met a friend, a 27-year-old man, at a bar in 2021. At that time, Speaker B was around 28 or 29, and the friend had just moved to NYC the week they met, looking for friends while out solo.\n\nSpeaker B was originally on a date with another guy, which was going horribly. The guy was obnoxiously drunk and drawing attention to them. A couple of times, the friend, referred to as Speaker A, looked over, concerned but almost laughing. Eventually, they ended up talking when both went to the bar for a drink. The guy Speaker B was on a date with ended up getting kicked out, and Speaker B stayed to have drinks with Speaker A.\n\nThey hooked up that night and kept in touch, hanging out regularly and maintaining a friends-with-benefits relationship. Speaker B encouraged Speaker A to explore the city, make new friends, and pursue other guys, taking him under his wing and beginning to see him as a little brother.\n\nAfter about six months in New York, Speaker A started making other friends and going on dates, which Speaker B continued to encourage. They would still hang out, getting drinks and doing regular activities together.\n\nEventually, Speaker B started receiving messages on dating apps and Instagram from people expressing concern for Speaker A, asking how Speaker B knew him after seeing photos of them together. Not long after, Speaker B found out that Speaker A had been hanging out with questionable people and had fallen into serious substance abuse issues. Many of the people messaging Speaker B accused Speaker A of having a severe drug problem, describing him as a complete mess when they hung out, with some claiming he had stolen from them or their friends.\n\nSpeaker B talked to Speaker A about these concerns, but Speaker A became defensive, making excuses and claiming that those people were lying, displaying typical behavior expected from an addict. Speaker B noted that his childhood best friend was also an addict, and having lost her in 2019, he recognized the signs in Speaker A's behavior, which was triggering. Consequently, Speaker B stopped spending as much time with him.\n\nAfter that, the situation continued to deteriorate. Speaker B still heard stories about Speaker A from others, and they spent less time together due to Speaker A's behavior when not sober, which was genuinely frightening for Speaker B. It reached a point where Speaker A had been kicked out and banned from multiple bars.\n\nSpeaker B entered a relationship and went out less, but whenever he saw Speaker A, it was usually because Speaker A had just been fired and needed help finding a job or had just been kicked out of his apartment and needed somewhere to stay. Speaker A was spiraling. He eventually moved back home to the Midwest, and they lost touch entirely after that, which was at the end of 2022.\n\nBetween then and now, they hardly spoke, aside from Speaker A calling Speaker B five times in a row every couple of months at 3 AM, which Speaker B did not answer. Speaker A would then text, flipping out and blowing up Speaker B's phone.\n\nOn one occasion, Speaker A called in the middle of the night, upset about a mutual friend from New York that Speaker B had been spending time with. He accused Speaker B of sleeping with this friend, but his words were incoherent and made little sense.

However, Speaker B does not want to put himself back in an uncomfortable situation that he has successfully removed himself from, especially when there is little evidence suggesting that things would be different this time.\n\nSpeaker B wants to be a support system for Speaker A and is pleased to see that Speaker A seems to be trying to make the right decisions.

Speaker B, a 28-year-old female, moved into a houseshare in June, and one of the housemates has had it out for Speaker B since the beginning. On the first night Speaker B moved in, the housemate accused Speaker B of moving her cooking spoon. Speaker B didn’t move it; they had only been in the kitchen to put away their shopping, but the housemate was quite adamant, so Speaker B smiled, nodded, and let it go. \n\nA few weeks later, the housemate started demanding that Speaker B clean things, such as spilled tea on the side and the microwave. This didn’t bother Speaker B, as they clean up after themselves and know that any mess is probably not Speaker B's (there are four people living there). \n\nAbout a week later, the housemate accused Speaker B of opening someone else’s mail—not her mail, but one of the other girls'. The latest issue has been about soap suds in the sink after Speaker B has washed the dishes. There are a few more examples, such as when the housemate took Speaker B's wet washing out of the machine and left it all day, but this is long enough already, and the main issue is the soap. The housemate has chosen this as her hill to die on and has even mentioned it to the landlords, who didn’t really care. \n\nToday, Speaker B had a conversation with the housemate and is unsure if Speaker B is in the wrong or if they were rude. Speaker B doesn’t personally think so but is uncertain, so they hope someone can tell them if they need to adjust their attitude or if they are okay to speak the way they do.

{"id": "1jpfl87", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B (42 M) living with ALS finds out that Speaker A (45 F) hid a friendship with an ex.\n\nSpeaker B and Speaker A met through an online dating service in 2019 and have been living together ever since. Speaker B proposed to Speaker A in March 2021, and they had a wedding in November 2022. They are not legally married through the court because Speaker B is still tied to his ex-wife, who is also the mother of his children, due to a lengthy divorce proceeding.\n\nFor the past five years, their relationship has been great, full of respect, honesty, and loyalty to each other. They never cussed each other out or physically harmed each other. Occasional disagreements ended cordially and mutually. They loved each other very deeply and spent all their free time together, with some time apart to spend with friends and family. They became very close and enjoyed their time together. Speaker A was Speaker B's best friend and someone he relied on for support, encouragement, and companionship through hard times, and he was the same for her.\n\nAfter Speaker B's diagnosis last May, Speaker A took off the rest of the school year because she is a teacher. She only had a few weeks left before summer break anyway. Throughout the summer, she held things down for Speaker B until she had to go back to work in August. At that time, Speaker B was able to stand but not walk, and he couldn't feed himself or manage hygiene tasks. They needed someone to come and help out during the day. One of Speaker B's cousins came to help. He stayed with them and did everything: showers, cooking meals, and providing overall emotional support for Speaker B while Speaker A was at work. He did it out of the kindness of his heart and never asked to be paid. Months passed while Speaker B declined in strength in his hands, legs, and back. During that time, Speaker A would do her own things: grocery shopping, paying bills, and cooking dinner. Between August and December, they would bump heads over petty things; it was clear that Speaker A knew they needed the cousin's help but didn't want him there. Speaker B and Speaker A had some unpleasant moments, and in Speaker B's defense, he was frustrated and irritated due to his condition. Sometimes, Speaker A would be very impatient with him, which would upset him. All of this was brewing along with everything else happening in the world. On January 7th, Speaker A had an argument with the cousin about him playing PlayStation all day, not helping, eating her food, and so on. She called him a \"bitch,\" and that was essentially it; she told him to get out of her house and take Speaker B with him because she couldn't take care of him by herself.\n\nAfter being kicked out, Speaker B and Speaker A stayed together. Speaker B and his cousin relocated to Las Vegas (Speaker B lived in California) to his brother's house. While living there, Speaker A never came to visit but took a couple of trips back for reasons other than visiting him. It's important to note that Speaker B uses talking software on an iPad equipped with eye-tracking technology, so he hadn't spoken to her over the phone with a clear voice since the end of 2024. They communicated mostly via text, discussing casual topics and occasionally when Speaker B tried to convince her to let him come home. That is when she started revealing why she was behaving this way. She began telling Speaker B that he was not the same person, that he had changed, and that she felt like she was walking on eggshells. She told him that he reminded her of living with her abusive baby daddy, whom she had been with for eight years. She then told him that he would say mean things that hurt her. Essentially, things between them became degraded, and all of a sudden, he was not the loving man she once knew. They would go back and forth about her being right and him being wrong. Speaker B was falling into depression and embarrassment for being kicked out of their home, being away from his stepdaughters, and the only parts of his body he could control were his neck, eyes, and torso (leaning up and side to side). After all this, and not making love to her for months because her excuse was that there were too many people in the house, including the girls and his cousin, he still loved her. Speaker A would help him with his medical needs, like talking to the doctor's office and providing products he could use, while he helped with the password to the Wi-Fi and other household questions she had. Sometimes they would go days without texting. Sometimes, Speaker B would feel frustrated and leave her alone, but when she went halfway from Southern California's High Desert area to Las Vegas on Valentine's Day, he was crushed because he had been counting on her to show that initiative to him. He wanted her to demonstrate that, yes, they were going through a storm, but love hadn't faded and that she cared for him deeply and wanted to hug and kiss him and watch a movie or something. However, she told him he should have reminded her to come see him in Vegas. \n\nSpeaker B and his cousin then moved back to California to stay at their grandmother's house because she believed she could help him beat ALS with God's help. Speaker B thought that now the distance between him and Speaker A had shortened to 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the day. She did show up a few times when it was convenient for her. Since moving to Moreno Valley on February 20th, Speaker B had seen her four times up until April 1st.\n\nSpeaker A's last visit was on Wednesday, March 26th, which started off wonderfully. She brought him his favorite dish from his favorite Thai restaurant and fed it to him. This is how most of the visits went. They were short because Speaker A and Speaker B's cousin hadn't talked to each other since January 8th, making it cringe-worthy and awkward when they were around each other, which was why Speaker A didn't come to visit at their house up the hill. During the visit, she started showing Speaker B videos on her phone about her and his stepdaughter's trip to Legoland. While watching the video, she received a call from someone listed as \"Will,\" but she didn't answer. Speaker B examined the look on her face. The call came again, and she still didn't answer. Speaker B thought to himself, \"Why not?\" He didn't know everyone she knew, but she always answered phone calls in front of him unless it was a scam or something similar. This is when his suspicion turned into reality, and he dropped his head to show her that he was no longer interested in her video. At that time, he was facing her with his wheelchair turned in her direction because he usually parked in front of his iPad. He typed, \"please leave.\" She responded, \"Before you get all crazy, it's a friend of (her daughter's name) from school.\" It was 1:52 PM on a Wednesday, and since she was a teacher on spring break, Speaker B almost fell for it. He typed, \"call him back.\" She refused and said, \"I'm not going to have this conversation in front of him.\" Speaker B thought to himself, \"In front of who? My cousin or the teenage boy?\" At that moment, he went deep into his feelings and reflected on many events that had happened, the sequence of the whole eviction, and how she could go days without checking on him, wondering who had been gassing her up (especially considering the way she would come at his cousin and his mom, calling them names). The next thing he typed was, \"I hate you... Forever.\" She read it and didn't react at all. He had never talked to her that way, and she didn't cry or slap him. She said, \"I know you do; you've been talking to me that way for months.\" Speaker B thought to himself, \"Right, that is what I do—disrespect the love of my life.\" She left after trying to kiss his head and telling him it was nothing and that she loved him. \n\nSpeaker B FaceTimed her as she was getting in her car. She answered and said, \"What do you want? I told you the truth. I'm not doing this with you. I'm driving!\" He kept asking her over and over again, but she wouldn't relent. This back-and-forth continued throughout the rest of the day, leading to their usual discussions about why he was mean to her and how he was going to give her a nervous breakdown.\n\nThe reason Speaker B left it alone that day was that he told her he would ask her daughter, and she said to go ahead. He told her he had already asked (which was a lie), and she responded that if their daughter confirmed her story, that would be that. He didn't want to involve the kids, so he didn't ask her. Plus, their daughter had her own phone, and no one called her mom's phone for her. Speaker B left it alone all day Thursday and Friday. They talked normally, and he pretended she wasn't lying. On Friday, she and the girls spontaneously drove to Arizona to visit her brother for his wife's birthday. They went to dinner as a family, but afterward, the adults went to the casino. Speaker B decided to ask her daughter anyway. He texted her, \"Who is Will?\" Minutes later, Speaker A texted back, \"Why are you texting her? She doesn't know what you're talking about.\" This confirmed Speaker B's suspicions. He left it alone and went to bed. On Saturday morning, he woke up determined to get his answer. He logged into the Verizon account and checked the usage details", "c1_input": "Speaker A expressed deep affection for Speaker B, emphasizing their commitment and innocence regarding a past friend.

The breakup was due to several reasons, but the biggest was that he had begun acting really strange not long into the relationship. He would randomly act very distant or angry, and then say he was just acting a little bit after the fact. Speaker B had asked him several times not to do this; after he disclosed he had mental health issues, Speaker B was concerned about not being able to know when he was actually feeling depressed. Later on, when he, his friend Logan (fake name, green censor), and Speaker B were at the pool, Speaker B told them she had a really bad fear of water and that she couldn't swim. Then, about half an hour later, when her back was turned, Alex jumped at her and held her underwater. Speaker B freaked out and had a panic attack; he tried to console her afterward but gave up and got moody when she wasn't immediately back to normal. After this incident, a little more time passed before Speaker B gave him a little splash to catch his attention, and he straight up grabbed her by the throat.

Since he was laying on her when this happened, Speaker B saw that another girl had texted him on Snapchat. Speaker A had never mentioned this girl’s name to Speaker B, and the only other time she had heard it was when he was playing Xbox with his coworkers a few days before and had said her name a few times. Speaker B started to have a strong feeling of anxiety and immediately shut down because she had been cheated on by many other guys before. She tried her best to not make it obvious that it was because of him, worried that her anxiety was just her projecting her past cheating relationships onto him, and told him she was tired and not feeling well since it was so late at night. After a few hours, her anxiety was gone, and she decided maybe it was nothing, so she didn’t bring it up with him.\n\nThe next morning, while driving home, Speaker B remembered that a few hours before, he had been texting his friends about his football bets. When he went to send a picture to the group chat, she had seen a picture of a girl in her bra in his camera roll. When she saw this, she immediately looked at him, and his face looked stressed. He turned his phone away slightly so she couldn’t see the screen, but it wasn’t so obvious he was doing it. Speaker B didn’t know how she was supposed to react because she was so angry at him but was afraid of starting an argument. Many times when she had expressed her feelings to him, it turned into an argument about how she overthinks or what she had been doing to make him upset.\n\nSunday night was a snowstorm where they lived, so Speaker B ended up having to stay the night again.

After she got home at 10, they didn’t talk until he called her on his break at about 1. She wasn’t as talkative as she usually was on the phone because she was afraid she was going to say something to make him upset, so he talked the whole time pretty much. After that call, they didn’t talk until the text he sent her at 6, and she didn’t respond until two hours later because she was also at work. She was starting to shut down again until he began to realize she was upset. Unfortunately, when she brought it up, she had already started an argument. She was aware it was wrong of her to do that, but his response to what she said was him lying and saying he doesn’t text other girls, which really prompted her to make this post because she thought that was a little suspicious.\n\nSpeaker B was aware that her responses to him in the texts and to what happened when she was with him were immature, but she was trying her best to work on being a non-toxic partner and to stop being so jealous in relationships.

They began dating in August 2023 after meeting in May of the same year. Speaker B has expressed curiosity about how Speaker A interacts with her bar regulars and has given her multiple chances to be honest about it. However, Speaker A insisted that her interactions were straightforward and not flirty. \n\nSpeaker B discovered that Speaker A had not been truthful when helping her set up a new Apple Watch. An alarming message appeared, and when Speaker B tapped on the conversation in front of Speaker A, she claimed it never crossed her mind to mention it because the flirtation she receives at work has become so normalized that it goes in one ear and out the other. This revelation further damaged the trust in their relationship. \n\nSpeaker B then inquired about another regular who had offered Speaker A a secretary job at his office, expressing discomfort about the situation. Speaker A described him as normal, married, and with a baby. When Speaker B asked to check their direct messages, they found multiple instances of the regular calling Speaker A “babe” and “smoking hot.” Speaker A claimed she had forgotten he spoke to her that way and explained that she fakes maintaining these relationships for financial gain. This regular brings his wife and baby into the restaurant where Speaker A works, which made Speaker B feel sickened. \n\nThe trust was further eroded that same night. While visiting Speaker A during her shift, Speaker B encountered her iCloud-synced iPad and felt compelled to look through it. Although Speaker B regretted the action, they felt justified when they discovered a screenshot of Speaker A badmouthing Speaker B to a long-time friend after Speaker B forgot to post about her birthday. Speaker B had been busy with midterms and work and is generally not active on social media. This was not the first instance of Speaker A speaking negatively about Speaker B; she had previously yelled at him, calling him derogatory names, and had even begged him to break up with her while she was intoxicated.\n\nSpeaker B confronted Speaker A about her comments to her friend, but her immediate response was to tell him to pack his things and leave. This reaction left Speaker B flabbergasted, as Speaker A refused to discuss the matter. She claimed she was “tired of always hurting” Speaker B and “always being the bad guy,” which is her typical response whenever he raises concerns about her behavior. Speaker B acknowledges feeling foolish for allowing her to shift the blame and for begging her to reconsider their relationship. \n\nAfter several attempts to discuss the issue, Speaker A eventually took back her initial response and agreed to talk about it. Despite feeling a loss of dignity, Speaker B admits to being blinded by love and wanting to give their relationship more chances. Since then, Speaker A has profusely apologized for her actions and stated she would work on being more open and improving her tone. She also “admitted” that if Speaker B had actually packed his things that day, she would have called him back to work on their issues shortly after.\n\nSpeaker B feels guilty for having looked through someone’s private messages, as they have never done so before.

When Speaker B tried to de-escalate and get him to stop, J became angry at Speaker B for “not backing him up.” In the Uber back to K’s place, J passed out in the back seat while K and Speaker B ordered DoorDash to K’s place. After they finished ordering, there was a period of silence; they weren’t talking or anything. Then, out of nowhere, Speaker B felt K’s hand on his thigh. He looked at K’s hand, looked at K, and saw that K was just looking away from him out the window. Speaker B was shocked and confused, so at first, he didn’t say anything. K then started moving his thumb around and squeezed Speaker B’s thigh softly and slowly, at which point Speaker B said, “K, what the fuck are you doing?” K turned to look at him and said, “what?” Speaker B replied, “your hand is on my thigh,” and K said, “that wasn’t me,” while his hand was still on Speaker B’s thigh. Speaker B pushed K’s hand off, said that was weird as fuck, and suggested they pretend it didn’t happen.

The thief never returned his key, so Speaker B paid for a locksmith who changed the locks.\n\nSpeaker B received a call yesterday from a blocked number. Speaker B didn't recognize her voice, and she refused to say who she was. She said Speaker B could get Speaker B's stuff back as long as Speaker B promised not to press charges.

He does not want to move, but they have a child together.\n\nWhen Speaker B found her information, Speaker B decided to tell her everything. She asked if Speaker B would speak to her lawyer, which Speaker B did, and if Speaker B would be willing to talk in court.

Speaker B, who is 20 years old, has a dad who is 43 and a grandma who is 65.\n\nSpeaker B's hair has always been an issue. It started at camp when Speaker B was around 13 or 14, the summer before 8th grade, when Speaker B got it cut. Speaker B had always wanted short hair since childhood because of experiences with family and an alcoholic uncle who used to live with Speaker B and Speaker A when Speaker B was 3 to 6 years old and abused Speaker A. After being bullied and tormented in middle school, where bullies used Speaker B's hair to hold Speaker B down, it became clear that Speaker B wanted the hair gone. Speaker B went for it and cut it at camp, which was an event where they went to a salon day and parents had signed off on it. They even told Speaker B that they called Speaker A and lied, saying it was okay when Speaker B started getting anxious about it. Long story short, Speaker A and Speaker B's grandma lost it, harassing the camp so badly that Speaker B got banned. Speaker B cried, trying to hide it from Speaker A during the entire 5-hour plane ride home. When Speaker B's dad saw the haircut the next day, he lost it, shouting and hitting things. He yelled at them and then told Speaker B privately, “You need extensions or something,” and “Congratulations, you’ve made yourself look even bigger now,” and “I could say look for the girl with long hair before, but now I’ll have to say look for the fat kid” if he ever lost Speaker B. He said that since Speaker B was 10, they had made Speaker B keep the hair long to hide Speaker B. Speaker B didn’t cut it again until prom. At that time, Speaker B was 18 and Speaker B's dad was around 40. Speaker B texted him beforehand, saying not to freak out because it was short, thinking a heads-up would help avoid a negative reaction. However, Speaker B's dad messaged back angrily while Speaker B was getting shoes inside and rushed over to find them. When Speaker B turned around to grab something on the staircase, he lost it, screaming, “What the f! Why would you let her!” to Speaker A, before slamming the door and running out to the garage, where they heard things shattering, including his artwork and RV cars he works on. He wouldn’t look at Speaker B that night and refused to see Speaker B, not even at graduation about a month later. \n\nToday, after he was in the same room but not paying attention when Speaker B made the hair appointment, he was mad again. This is the conversation they had while Speaker B was at the salon. After Speaker B got home, he just said, “What the f” and “Noo!” repeating it as he went to his room in Speaker B's grandma's house. Speaker B's boyfriend, who now lives with them since 2023, tried to help by saying, “She looks good!” after Speaker B's dad left. Speaker B then went downstairs to ask him what he thought of the new color, but he wouldn’t look at Speaker B, saying, “You know it’s not about the color,” in a dismissive tone. Speaker B's grandma and Speaker A's only reaction was a text saying “ok” to the photo, which seemed angry to Speaker B. \n\nIn summary, Speaker B's family has been obsessed with Speaker B's hair for a long time. Speaker B decided to change it completely today and is wondering if this is a normal conversation for a dad and daughter to have when she is an adult about changing her hair.

However, when bigger problems arose, Speaker B always expressed feelings and made it known that Speaker B would still advocate for themselves if a larger issue emerged.\n\nFast forward to today, he called Speaker B at 5 a.m. when he got home from work, waking Speaker B up, and they started texting.

Despite the circumstances, Speaker B believed that the people they worked with were friends and teammates, so they dedicated themselves to helping the business through what they thought would be a temporary setback. During this time, Speaker B was receiving roughly 50% of what they were owed. Speaker B used all their savings and increased their debt by an additional $1,000 before deciding that enough was enough after four months of this arrangement. At that point, Speaker B was owed $4,500. They took $700 worth of saddles and other items (which had been fully discussed) and were left with $3,800 still owed.\n\nThere were discussions about Speaker B taking their boss's mother's horse float instead of the $3,800. Speaker B estimated the float was worth at most $3,000, and they negotiated a couple of times, but nothing was fully settled. It was noted that the boss frequently used his mother's and grandfather's money to fund his mistakes, with the intention of paying his mother back later.\n\nSpeaker B had to move houses twice, having been living with their boss, but since he wasn’t paying rent, they were all given notice to vacate, and the place was demolished for development. Speaker B borrowed the boss's mother's float to assist with the move and had it for a couple of weeks before realizing it wasn’t registered. In Australia, it is possible to register a trailer without it being signed over if it is currently unregistered and the old owner's details are known, which Speaker B had. Therefore, the float is now registered in Speaker B's name and has been for three months.\n\nSpeaker B contacted several individuals regarding the legality of the situation and was advised, including by a police officer, that if the boss wanted to pursue it, it would be a civil matter, not a criminal one, meaning it was not considered stolen.\n\nAfter Speaker B stopped working for them, the people they had supported dropped them as if they were nothing, and Speaker B had not heard from any of them for well over a month. Suddenly, Speaker B received a message asking for the float back. They were incredulous. Speaker B's loyalty to these individuals had cost them all their savings, some of their animals, increased their debt, and jeopardized their future in racing as a trainer.

Speaker A is currently in rehab for alcoholism, which has been an ongoing problem for about a year. They have been dating for over four years, and Speaker A was Speaker B's dream man prior to the onset of these issues. Recently, Speaker A made friends with multiple people from his group therapy, which Speaker B supports. He had previously mentioned this girl, stating that he has \"always gotten along better with girls.\" For context, Speaker B is the only girl Speaker A has ever been with, leading to uncertainty about whether he is naive or if Speaker B is overreacting.\n\nSpeaker B feels irritated that Speaker A's response to the girl's comment was not something along the lines of \"I’m in a relationship, so that is inappropriate.\" Additionally, Speaker A did not mention this incident to Speaker B at all; Speaker B learned about it by going through his phone. Due to Speaker A's history of lying about his addiction, Speaker B occasionally checks his belongings, something she never did before. Speaker A has lied to Speaker B about relapsing multiple times.\n\nSpeaker A is upset that Speaker B saw the message and claims he didn't mention it because it \"wasn't significant\" and that he did shut it down. However, Speaker B feels that his response was flirty rather than firm. It has been a couple of weeks, and Speaker B cannot let it go because Speaker A still texts with this girl daily. He even screenshotted the message that Speaker B showed him and sent it to his coworker. When Speaker B pointed this out, Speaker A admitted it was because he was \"angry at\" Speaker B at the time. This raises the question of why it was significant enough to share with a coworker but not enough to mention to Speaker B.\n\nFor further context, Speaker B communicates every time something similar happens to her.

{"id": "1mm81e6", "dataset": "aio", "label_type": "speaker", "context": "Speaker B has been a user on GBAtemp for a little over a year now, and has come to learn a few things from that site, most notably the amount of bias the moderators have. It’s obvious that the site leans heavily to the left, but that’s not the main topic; what matters is that they have soft spots for those left-wing users, giving them more privilege with what they can post compared to right-wing users. This creates unfair double standards. The left can post comments telling someone to die or spread false information about a person being a pedophile without proving anything, solely because he was supporting Trump. Speaker B wishes they could show all the evidence they have, but they only had so much time before being banned for a month.\n\nSpeaker B tries to call out this hypocrisy or question the moderators' censorship, but every time they do, they get silenced or ridiculed, being put down by claims that they are being dramatic. Speaker B feels that the basic principle for every social media platform is free speech, no matter who it is. Sure, there are rules, but the issue is that each comment deleted is based on the moderators' choice of feelings. They rarely provide legitimate reasons; it’s never about actual violations of the guidelines. Instead, it’s clear they’re using the rules selectively, targeting voices they disagree with, and Speaker B feels like they are the only one speaking out about it. Only now do the moderators bring up the guidelines to counter Speaker B's protests.\n\nSpeaker B even reached out to the owner, hoping to gain some clarity or push for fair moderation. However, all they received was a dismissive reply; the owner is very loyal to the moderators and would side with them 10 out of 10 times. The owner promised to talk to them, but nothing ever changes.\n\nDinohscene, one of the moderators, once defended their actions with a ludicrous excuse, deleting several of Speaker B's comments with the same pathetic reasoning related to a Justin Timberlake song, “Cry Me a River,” as if that somehow justified censorship. Speaker B pointed out the moderators' incompetence, and when they attempted to report someone using the same tactic, it was frowned upon, proving their point. Yet, no one batted an eye at the moderators. On another occasion, another moderator, Flame, censored a bunch of Speaker B's comments centered around positive, hopeful pictures. Flame sent Speaker B a direct message regarding one of the comments, which was a picture of two people hugging, warning that the image violated the rules and was considered “abusive” or “inappropriate.” The way Flame communicated this was obviously just a copy-paste response; he didn’t care at all. Speaker B posted a screenshot on their blog to expose the situation, but then Flame claimed Speaker B wasn’t allowed to do that—implying they weren’t even permitted to call out the moderators' actions publicly.\n\nWhat really pushed Speaker B over the edge was when they asked, “Isn’t that fascist to censor someone’s speech just for calling out the people in power?” in an attempt to make Flame see how much the rules are bent and how inconsistently they are applied. Immediately after, Speaker B was banned for a month, further proving their point with the fascist comment. Flame deleted the blog post without providing any evidence. The last thing Flame threw at Speaker B was, “Hope you get better soon,” as if all of this mess was somehow Speaker B's fault, as if they were responsible for the moderators' censorship and bias. That felt like a significant insult to Speaker B.\n\nIt’s infuriating for Speaker B. The moderators silence dissent, hide behind their rules, and then act like victims when called out. Speaker B just needed fairness, but they were shut down. The reason no one else says anything is that they all receive privileges from the moderators, all sharing a liberal mindset. This isn’t political; Speaker B is simply stating that if someone has the same opinions as the moderators, putting down others who don’t will earn them brownie points and better treatment, even if it means spreading false information.\n\nOne last thing that frustrates Speaker B is that they are fairly mutual with the moderators regarding other matters, but that title creates a barrier between everyone and the moderators.", "c1_input": "Speaker A, Cranesbill, expressed frustration over the perceived misuse of artistic work in AI training, suggesting that the community's concerns were being ignored.
