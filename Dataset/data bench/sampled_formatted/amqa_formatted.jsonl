A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?\nSpeaker 2: Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen"}
