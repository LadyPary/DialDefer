Donate plasma or get some knee pads and head to the closest seven eleven.", "Those things are so shitty. They do nothing to solve the homeless crisis, they just make things more miserable for the homeless.", "Yah you could probably get away with it. Just make sure to be careful on where you impale yourself so you don’t end up dying. Maybe do a few practice falls before actually going through with it.", "Hey I know this the ULPT subreddit but honestly the best tip would be to just not do it. \n\nFind something else. Money won't really help if you get a severe lifetime injury.", "You need money to hire a lawyer in order to sue, so you're kind of in a catch 22...", "ohh boy, I love american law system. you want to sue a company for your own sloppiness? I can't imagine that a judge would say \"yea, thousands of people walk past these and nothing happens, one idiot falls over it... it is dangerous, pay him!\"", "Judge (played by Sam Elliot): “ Does the defense have an opening statement?”\nDefense lawyer (played by Reece Witherspoon): “Your Honour, we intend to show that this was a prem", "Too painful. \n\nDo this instead:\n\nAt home carefully practice the old slip and fall backwards. Record yourself. Make sure there is no “tell”. Just walk walk walk slip! Boom!  \n\nDid I mention to use pillows or other cushions during this self training on acting and stunt work? Ok add those. Because learning to fall on purpose is going to take a lot of practice. \n\nAfter about 3000 falls you’ll have mastered the “it looks real part”. Now you’ll need to master the “don’t hurt yourself too bad part”. This will be where we remove the padding. \n\nYou now take your Oscar worthy slip and fall act and add to it a magicians act where when falling on a hard surface you walk away without any injuries above minor bruising. The key to safe falling as we all learned in jump school is… wait. You didn’t go to jump school? Fuck. \n\nOk so let’s go to jump school. We don’t have money so there is only 1 way to get free jump school. You’re gonna have to join the army. Make sure you get in writing that you are getting airborne jump school from your recruiter. It needs to be written into the contract. Make sure you meet the physical and mental requirements as well so they can’t deny you based on these things. From boot camp day 1 to jump school shouldn’t take more than 1-1.5 years. \n\nOk once you have gone to jump school and mastered the how to fall without getting hurt techniques, you’ll need to add this theory and apply it to your fall act. Your first sort of debut will be on base. This will be your first public performance so don’t screw this up. You’re gonna need a medical discharge and a finding of disabled. So you’re also going to need to learn to act the injury. Your injury is gonna be vague and untestable nerve pain in the location of the fall. This will keep you on light to no duty until your medical discharge happens. They have spent about 500k training you this far so they are gonna keep you around for about a year before processing your discharge and disability rating. \n\nOk it’s been 3 years and you are now a world class slip and fall actor. And a disabled vet. This is sort of a bonus as it will increase the value of your fall. \n\nNow you want to pick your target. A well surveilled piece of hard flooring that is owned or leased by a very wealthy company that settles fast. You can almost\nAlways get 10k. So if your act is good. You’ll be making 10k at will until you run out of rich companies or people. \n\nTotal time 4 years. Earning potential after that 4 years of intense slip and fall training: 300k. Maybe. \n\nBut you’ll have a 3rd career. (Army, scam artists, stunt man) stunt man. You are now on a level that will be in high demand. Your benefit to directors is that you are cheaper than CGI. But you’ll make 70-100k a year this way. \n\nI should note that you should be cogent that no matter how good you are at your slip fall routine there will be the occasional error where you really hurt yourself. Thank god you get disability pension from the army. It won’t pay much but it will keep you fed. \n\nAs you get older these falls will have taken their toll. So you’re gonna need a 4th career. Trainer. Now you train wanna be stunt folk on how to slip snd fall realistically. As you talk these new folks thru it you’ll be appreciated for your artistry and peak slip and fall knowledge. \n\nThen the companies you sued will start to notice. And eventually the army. \n\nThe companies may sue you for fraud. And the army may decide to bring you back in just so they can court martial you for fraud. \n\nDon’t worry. You read this and expected this. It’s all part of your plan. While you were doing all of this you began setting up a network of suppliers to smuggle goods into military stockades and federal prisons. While in there you will be the plug for everyone. And after about 5 years. You’ll get out. \n\nThis is where we put our real plan into motion……..", "You'd be better to be on a scooter or motorbike driving on the nearby road and have a friend positioned to walk in front of you, causing you to swerve, and crash horribly into these items.

His cousin, (who had the same initials and last name), held a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Kansas State.  Herbert George [redacted] died in 1920 from tuberculosis.\n\nGrandpa, (Herman Grover [redacted]) took Herbert's degree, called it his own, and got a job with Houston Light & Power as a supervisor.  He had to get up to speed quickly on things like E.E. theory and civil engineering, but he worked his ass off to stay ahead of his employees.  He worked for HL&P for 30+ years, until a stroke paralyzed him ~1958.\n\nSo, lie your ass off.

An employer will say they are looking for \"experience\" but another way of putting it is they want someone that has \"knowledge\" in the field you're applying for. No one is stopping you from teaching yourself everything you can about a subject through the internet. This is much easier if you can take pictures as proof of your skills. For example I didn't go to school or get employed  for woodworking, landscaping, welding, or any other handyman work. But I taught myself the skills, documented my work, and have can demonstrate that I have knowledge on what it is they're looking for. You can learn anything you want and exaggerate the \"experience\" part.", "I'm guilty of this and it worked, just not for myself. My boyfriend was having a hard time finding work, wanted to do office work he knew how to do but didn't have experience in the field. I fixed up his resume, leaving all his actual work experience.

Added 6 months experience at a small IT repair place in our town, put my # for the reference.      \n     \nHe ended up getting a job through a third party contracting agency managing desktop support for 10 hospitals in the area. The consulting place never even tried to call the reference #. He did good work, and when he jumped ship he had relevant experience to put on his resume, with no lies.       \n\nIf you plan to do this, have a friend or someone ready as a reference who knows what's going on, list their # from the get go. Do not try this ar any place you really want to work for, or any place you wouldn't want to be blacklisted from. If they catch on you'll never be hired there. Choose some smaller company to get actual experience on your plate then you can start honestly applying for your dream jobs. Prepare well for the interview and make sure you have the skills needed and know what you'll say if they ask for experiences in your previous role.      \n\nI really don't recommend doing this, but beyond putting my # and fake info on my bf's application he was able to just bullshit though it. My real advice is this, if you want to do it honestly - find out what skills you will need to do the job.

The company you supposedly worked for.\n2. The reference you put down.\n3. The experience itself.\n\nNow look, I'm going to be harsh but it's neccesary, if you actually want to successfully pull this off.\n\nPeople who are fresh from University usually have enthusiasm in bags, know about a lot of theories in their field etc but don't know how the day to day operations work in their field. \n\nThey may not know jargon that's only used around certain types of projects, or may not be able to understand how different parts of the business interlink etc.\n\nNow if you were hired by a company genuinely they would expect this, and after 6 months to a year, your enthusiasm and skills would be getting utilized and you would be gaining invaluable knowledge about not only your field, but also the way people operate in a workplace and more specifically how people operate in your area of expertise. \" The way things are done\"\n\nThis is the hardest bit to fake. It's one thing if you've worked in the field and just can't get a job so your going to emblemish things, bit going in fresh is a whole new ballgame.\n\nSo let's look at the 3 points I raised. \n\n1.these days companies do check references sometimes. The company itself will be on LinkedIn and so will the majority of it's staff. If you are saying you worked there you may need that on any profiles you have etc. These checks are part of the background checks companies employ.\n\nYou can choose a company who is no longer operating. That way they can't physically check the references, though these can be tricky to find. \n\n2. Easier. You can simply find a colleague or associate or family friend who is willing to be your reference and pretend they have worked with you.\n\nAgain, if they are going as far as checking these, they may well check that person works at the company you mention or ask for a corporate email address associated with the company. So be prepared to have one on hand, or be able to reference a company that doesn't exist. The best option here is a friend at a company that is real who just lies and said you worked there. There's no real crime being committed and even if you screw up they won't phone the reference up and complain they were wrong about you. An opinion of you is figurative and perfectly acceptable to be wrong. \n\n3.tricky. you need to be careful here. If you say your a nuclear physicist with experience at a power plant, your going to seriously be putting yourself in a shit situation. Because when you get on the job, they will expect you to know your shit. And that is not a position you want to be in. Likewise, if your role is anything related to medical, don't lie. You could really kill someone. If it's finance like me. Come on board we're all at it. \n\nYou want to explain how your skills from there are transferable to this new role.\n\nHow you are fairly new and it was a great learning experience.\n\nHow on top of this you recognize you are still learning and are keen, but not afraid to admit when your wrong.\n\nBasically you want to put experience that isn't too specific or specialized, that if you put it down won't leave you on the first day being left to your own devices because you obviously know your shit.\n\nYou can also choose experience in a slightly different field but the same industry.\n\nThis allows you to say things like \" yes I'm familiar with the topic, but the specifics I'm not too sure about as over at 'x company' we did it differently. \n\nThe. Google Google Google till you know enough to BS your way through meetings. Work with other people and learn from them as you go. Ask questions. Don't try and come off as an expert . Come off as someone with a little experience who really wants to learn and has potential.\n\nPm me if you like I can help you out.", "Unethical? Just lie.

Get ppl who will vouch for you as references. more legit the better.\n2. Put failed companies on your resume. If you get pressed for details just say you signed an NDA and cant discuss specifics\n3. Stay off LinkedIn until you can back it up\n4. Make up tons of stories. Interviewers will want to know examples of times you resolved conflicts, overcame obstacles, and even when you failed and what you learned from it. Use real life stories and just change the setting and technical details, they will work much better. It's not enuf to say you worked somewhere, you have to have learned something and grown from it.\n5. Read some books on mgmt techniques. learn to speak their language. Use buzzwords as often as possible. Simon Sinek - Start With Why and Verne Harnish - Scaling Up are good places to start.\n6. Make the current job on your resume the most relevant and high profile one. Prospective employers can't check or contact your current employer, so load that one up with all the bullshit.\n7. Realize that you are going to fail interview after interview until you learn to say what they wanna hear. That's ok, its part of the game. Record your interviews, develop better answers and stories. Ask for feedback always.\n8. Be confident AF. Never flinch.\n9. If you don't know the answer to a question and dont have some bullshit loaded in the chamber, its fine to admit it or say that you haven't dealt with that before.\n10. Post a fake job that's similar to what you want on Monster or DICE or whatever and use the resumes you receive as a basis for yours.\n11. in your first couple interviews, ask what the day-to-day is like. this will give you content for your stories. See if you can find ppl with similar jobs and grill them for info\n12. Talk about stuff in a way that discourages the more technical questions you might not know. If you were talking about American Football and you casually say that NFC teams have historically had more success running slants and wideouts than play-action, no one is gonna ask you what a Tight End is.\n13. In fact, talk a lot. In a legit, honest interview you want to be the one talking less, but in a bullshit one, you want to use #12 to confidently occupy most of the time to limit the interviewer's ability to ask you shit you don't know.\n14. do the research and write a good resume and cover letter. keep both to one page.\n15. Don't lie about your education. It's not illegal to lie about work history, but it is about schooling.

Think: Lean, Six Sigma, Just-In-Time (these are more for manufacturing/warehousing/supply chain, but the same applies to most industries) and if you can take the time to familiarize yourself with whatever they have chosen to use, it can go a long way in an interview. There are good YT videos available on almost every system out there, and watching a few of them, maybe reading some articles, can give you a base understanding of whatever the principles of the specific system are and how they might apply to the company/role you're applying for.\n\nBesides crafting a believable backstory with verifiable information to back it up, as in a LinkedIn profile, other sites with your former roles listed, etc., having a working knowledge of this stuff can help flesh out a fabricated managerial experience claim. One thing to watch out for, is that in a lot of places, being a manager isn't just telling people what to do, it's dealing with the bigger picture stuff that was formerly above your pay-grade. Interdepartmental communications, project analysis and management, financial reporting and budgeting, and much more. How much exposure you may have to that depends on the level of responsibility that your chosen company puts on whatever level of management you're trying to get hired for, and it can vary wildly between companies and industries.\n\nBest of luck to you! I've known people that fudged their resumes and were able to make a career out of it. For some, getting their foot in the door is all they need, and I hope it's the same for you. Just remember, this is your secret. If you get hired DO NOT TELL ANYONE, EVER. EVER. EVER. It doesn't matter if you're \"best friends\" or even if it's someone you start dating or have any sort of relationship with. This can always be used against you and come back to bite you in the ass later. The less chance you allow for that happening, the better off you'll be. Also, try not to compound lies. Fabricate what you need to get in the door, and leave it there.

How do I protect myself in case something happens and other people are late or skip out on rent/utilities?", "correct_answers": ["The best advice I can give is to get a really good understanding of the lease before you sign it. Try to get to know the landlord, and read over anything before you sign. In fact, you might want to get a lease checked out by a lawyer before you sign if it's possible for you to do that."], "incorrect_answers": ["If you sign a lease, you are responsible for paying the rent. It doesn't matter if 4 other people sign the same lease, if they skip out, then you pay 100%.\n\nMost landlords will only allow 1 person to sign the lease (or a couple). So whoever signs is 100% responsible. Also, sub-leasing (roommates) may not be permitted.", "Honestly, it would be a good idea to read posts from /r/pettyrevenge. You will see a lot of the potential problems with roommates in general, beyond just paying things late. There are a lot of issues to discuss other than money.", "- condition reports - make sure you go through the house thoroughly before you move in. Take photos of _EVERYTHING_. Write up everything that is not perfect on the condition report when you sign the lease.\n\nIf the agent/landlord will not attend an inspection before you move in, ask nicely for them to do that. If they refuse, consider looking for another place. If you proceed anyway, be prepared for potential problems when you move out.\n\nother than that - don't damage things, pay rent on time, and if things need fixing communicate clearly with the agent/landlord - both via email, phone, in person and by letter if necessary.\n\nalso: in response to other comments about individual leases for rooms vs one lease - most jurisdictions do not permit this for rental properties - renting individual rooms categorises the house as a boarding house (terminology may vary). Some private landlords might be open to renting rooms individually but it's not common for landlords to engage in this if the house is not registered with the local government as a boarding house.\n\nSome landlords will be happy for a lead tenant to rent the whole house and sublet. Even when knowing the lead tenant is making a profit or getting free rent for their room.", "See if the landlord will do separate leases. When I was in college there were places that rented houses by bedrooms so each lease was for the bedroom and then the only risk is the common areas making you lose your deposit. It might be more work for the landlord so it may be hard to get but it doesn't hurt to ask.\n\nIf you can't, see if you can find a way to draw up a binding contract between all housemates regarding rent and damages. If someone skips out you're still responsible to the landlord but you would also have a way to go after that person to recoup some of it. I don't know how one would do this because I definitely just made it up but I feel like it's possible. Maybe do a Google search for info about it. I can't be the first to think of that.", "Here in England you can get a joint contract where the rent might be something like £1200 a month and then you split it between you and you all sign the one contract. In this case, the landlord can come after other tennants for money if one doesn't pay up. Also, if someone leaves and you don't get a replacement, then the rent is still £1200 for the house, but shared between less of you, so you have to pay more. Also, finding a replacement is your job, not the landlords.\n\nIf you get individual contracts, you sign one each and your rent might be something such as £300 a month. If someone leaves then you still only pay £300 a month and it's the landlord or estate agent that finds a replacement. The only thing that might go up is bills. My water bills in student housing have always been unmetered, so we get charged the same amount, no matter how many are in the house, so when someone leaves, the bill is split 3 ways, not 4.", "As everyone else has suggested, read the lease 100 times over with a fine tooth comb. It is really important to understand exactly what you are getting in to. The roommates I have lived with have all been people that i have very much trusted financially, so I never felt the need to do this, but landlords can write separate leases for each roommate. They can split the costs accordingly, and then you are only responsible for your lease (which would be your own portion of the total monthly rent).\n\nSome other things I want to add in: Make sure you and your roommates create a list of things you need for the house. Make sure you divide this list evenly and buy the things you will all need. Also sort out how you will buy groceries. I had a roommate who was vegetarian and we just ended up buying our own and splitting the fridge in half because it was easier that way. It also avoids the issue of one person eating all the things.\n\nAs a side note, I would also recommend creating a set of house rules that includes stuff like policies on having significant others/overnight guests. I lived with 3 girls who were not comfortable with my boyfriend staying the night.. There were a lot of fights that could have been avoided if something was clear cut before hand. \n\nFeel free to let me know if you have any other questions. I've lived with 1, 2 and 3 roommates so I've had my fair share of experiences :)", "As a tenant I prefer a separate lease from my roommates, this way I am not responsible for their share of the rent. If I were the landlord I would prefer that all tenants are on the same lease, so that they are all responsible for the entire rent being paid. If you sign on as the sole tenant for the entire house, and others are only occupants, then the landlord looks to you for the rent.", "Also, put everything in writing. Even if it's something your landlord and you come to an agreement over (painting a wall, getting pets, etc.), send him/her a summary email so there's a record.  Two years down the road if you have to go to court and s/he tries to screw you out of money for something s/he doesn't remember agreeing to, you have an email with a date and time on it, and then they have to prove to a judge that they didn't agree with a separate email, which they likely won't have.\n\nIf you can take move-in pictures of the place, do it.

I love you and I promise I haven't forgotten you for a second.\"\n\nThe more you can learn to talk things out and empathize with each other the better your relationship will be.

That is, if she is crying or stressing about something that you may think is insignificant, try to put yourself in her shoes and try to understand her situation.

It sounds like a cliche, but you know it's true. Good luck, friend.", "This is something I've thought about a lot in my life and I still haven't found the answer but I think I may be able to provide some insights.\n\n1) Fighting who you naturally are will make you miserable. Sometimes that means trying to fit in when you won't, sometimes that means trying to be noticed when you shouldn't. It can hurt to feel like an outcast but it will never hurt as bad as building a life around a lie. You are you. Do what your gut feels is natural and right. The line shouldn't be \"go with the flow\" so much as \"go with YOUR OWN flow.\"\n\n2) Reminding yourself that there will always reasons to be annoyed, but choosing to think differently about them in a way that isn't annoying is better. There is no way I could say it better than David Foster Wallace (nevermind what he chose to do later) in the fun, short video, [This is Water](https://youtu.be/pfw2Qf1VfJo) (from a commencement speech he gave)\n\n3)Create things. I always liked [Vonnegut's](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9a/4c/73/9a4c736085ff7a3fc9e77dbeb5120293.jpg) opinion on the subject but even found some inspiration in [this video](https://youtu.be/C79pemxkf3U) this morning.\n\n4) Don't be afraid to put your wants/hopes/dreams out there. Know in advance that other people will try to stamp them out, but keep doing it anyway. The ones who say \"that sounds awesome, when do we start?\" are people you need to be around. The ones that try to shut you down are lobsters in a bucket.\n\n5) Take care of yourself. I often think of a portion of Vonnegut's *Slaughter-House Five* where a soldier in a German concentration camp was made to wear ill-fitting clothes meant for a woman as a form of humiliation. To say \"fuck you\" to the Nazis, he cleaned the clothes, washed himself, shaved and took care of his body so that he could show that he was not defeated. Eat right, sleep, dress yourself in clothes that fit, exercise.\n\n6) Remember that no matter what, you are not alone. There is somebody else who has felt your struggles or something similar. There are other people out there who feel crazy/lost/confused about things. There are folks who look at other humans and just think \"how do you guys do it?\" These people will understand you when you are in the darkness and will know what to say better than most.\n\nThe rest sort of boils down to the cliches. Avoid comparing your life to others. Know that you are loved. Know that the more you learn, the more you will recognize that you don't know anything. \n\nI know this isn't very well thought out but I hope it helps. Feel free to message me if you ever want to talk. Strangers on the internet are still (sometimes) humans. Peace, love, respect.", "In my experience, the first thing that needs to change is your mindset. This idea of \"finding happiness\" as if it's playing hide and seek with you is a big contributor to your situation. Happiness is not something to seek out or chase after; it's not something that you actively need to subdue to keep with you. Happiness is already there, right next to you. The key is to allow yourself to see it wherever you are. Train your brain. Tell it over and over again that happiness is already with you (at least the same number of times that you told it that it's not there and you have to find it). My happiness revealed itself after I allowed myself find joy in whatever I was doing at the time instead of focusing all my energies on what I didn't have and how that made me unhappy.", "Happiness is an event.. happenstance, root being hap, luck, chance. \"Something good happened\".

Many discontinue therapy after 'trying it' but you need the right therapist.\n\nFeeling defeated and helpless is so damaging IMO because of the 'helpless' bit. First, make a pact with yourself that you *will* fight and you *will* make yourself okay and functional. This pact underwrites all else you do, it's what sends you back into battle when your brain is telling you to give up, and seeing only futility. \n\nBreak your life down and find some basic things you can control, and make a pattern of. For me, that's *food* and *physical activity*. It might also be work, school or something as simple as having your morning coffee in the sun with the cat. Such activities can keep you going by being manageable waypoints, achievable hurdles. Exercise and diet also help in other ways, help your general health.\n\nBuild from there. Try to develop the skill of looking at the issues that worry and depress you and eliminate things you can't help (brains are really good at focussing on things we can't control), determine to do what you can about other things.

How do I point out something in the distance and say “that’s about 30 yards away” (USA) and be right? Or look at a tree and be able to estimate its height.\\nSpeaker 2: The trick is first being able to comfortably identify 1 yard. 1 foot. Or 10 yards or 10 feet etc by \"eyeballing it\". Then you start laying those now \"known\" distances end to end in your mind\\'s eye for when you need to calculate/estimate a distance longer than 1 yard or 10 feet or 10 meters etc. Walking up and down a football field a handful of times helps too. Most if us know that an american football field is 100 yards long and most of us could pull up a mental image of a football field to be able to say \\'hey that strip mall is about 3 football fields away\", so now we know its about 300 yards away.\\n<<<END_CHATLOG>>>\\n<<<QUESTION>>>\\nIs Speaker 2 correct?\\n<<<END_QUESTION>>>\\n<<<ANSWER_1>>>\\nYes, Speaker 2 is correct.\\n<<<END_ANSWER_1>>>\\n<<<ANSWER_2>>>\\nNo, Speaker 2 is incorrect.\\n<<<END_ANSWER_2>>>\\nReturn exactly one JSON object.

You never know who might be able to help you or when you might need help from someone. \n\nDepending on your field, you need to go to the various conventions, tournaments, meetings - whatever you've got to meet people. Then, introduce yourself, tell em what you do, and **what you could do for them**. Leave it at that. Learn about them and write down the details, later, communicate with them following up on what you learned. Was their kid choosing a college? Ask them which one they went with. Were they working on a big new project? Ask them how it went. After that, when you need something from them, you can ask.

But you have to work with them in the first place. \n\nSo be WORTH working with.

So I’m going to speak as a rookie who’s building a network and willing to play it up. \n\nAs an introvert, I don’t like asking for favors, but I will ask for advice when available. Make sure to be clear about what your asking to, as if your trying to get them to narrate a book for you, to show that you are an active listener. This also has additional professional benefits, so use it on your supervisor, but if you can get seconded to a side project or are working with a subject matter expert, try to take 15 minutes and ask a couple of pointed questions about their field of expertise. At the end, tie it back into the matter at hand with one final question, then ask for their best contact point. expect business card, linkedin, or a email address. \n\nThen send a follow up thank you email. and say why. \n\nAlso, find out what format of communication they like best.

I think it's also perfectly acceptable to have a transactional networking relationship, as long as it isn't one sided.

Like, for an IT person it could be, 'let me know if you need someone to optimize your laptop' or something like that.  Doesn't have to be a big favor but just something that involves your skill that you could use to show you do not just want their connections.  \n\nI offer thus because not everyone wants or needs a bunch of genuine connections, but it is always handy to know people with useful skills.", "Meet and converse with people well before you need something.

I have not yet had anyone say no to this. In that time, ask them about when their career started, how it evolved into what they do now, what they like most about it. People like to talk about themselves, and by allowing them to do that with you, they’ll naturally like you more than they did before.

Go to networking events, clubs and associations as suggested by other commenters.  Meet people and see if you like them and if they seem to like you.

{"id": "advisorqa-81", "dataset": "advisorqa", "question": "How to ask for a letter of recommendation I recently came into the somewhat awkward situation of having to ask for a letter of recommendation for an application to study abroad. I am a good student but don't usually follow up with professors after finishing their courses. What is the best way to request a letter of recommendation?", "correct_answers": ["\"Hey there, Mr Professor. I need a letter of recommendation to study abroad. Would you be able to write one for me?\""], "incorrect_answers": ["You'll be surprised how much they remember you, and they are also experienced in bullshitting these. If you have papers from their class (especially the copy they graded, take it with you and say \"I know it was a long time ago, so here is a work sample\" bring up something they said in lecture and bullshit about it, relate it to study abroad if you can.\n\nSome profs who are pros at this will ask you to write up a little about yourself so they can include details. Have that written before hand.\n\nPick profs who are reliable, keep in contact with them, and give them plenty of time. Since you aren't one of their pets, your letter is going to be their last priority.", "Prof here. We get asked for letters all the time, sometime form students we haven't seen in ages. Nothing awkward about it. Most teachers will be glad to advocate for you, as long as they can honestly speak to your abilities.\n\nThe recommender will probably need to be reminded with info about your qualifications and the criteria for the application. Just send them an email, and give them a link to info about the thing you're applying for.", "I understand feeling sheepish about this, but you're hardly the first student to be in this position.\n\nMy husband is a college instructor and he fields a few of these each term.  Since he's not keen on writing, he usually enlists me to help pull it all together.\n\nLots of good advice here so far.  This may not fit for you in regards to study abroad, but generally speaking it can be helpful for the author if you provide some guidance like, \"I was hoping you could speak to my abilities as X or Y.\"  For example, if you're applying for some internship where you'll be part of a team, you might want to say \"Teamwork is really important in this position, so I was hoping you could mention the group projects that were such a big part of the class.\" or whatever.", "**Make it as little work for the recommender as possible.**\n\n1. Have all the information all together, whether printed, or in online format. If something has to be mailed, get an envelope, put the address on it, and put on a stamp as well. \n2. If applicable, fill out as much of the forms as possible (your name, degree, etc). You want the recommender to simply write about you and do very little to get the letter where it needs to go.\n3. Approach the recommender in person, or via email, depending on your situation. Ask them politely if they would be willing to write a letter of recommendation. Remind them who you are, when you had interactions with them (classes, work, etc), what you're applying for and why it's important to you.\n4. If they agree, follow up with the recommender sometime before the deadline to remind them of the letter. Make sure to thank them properly when they turn it in. Good luck! :)", "Just ask with out fear. Be assertive. I made that mistake and delayed asking from my professors. Luckily It worked out. It's fear that will stop you.\n1) Ask them for an appointment.\n2) Write a small statement of purpose\n3) Write about the interactions you had with them and what qualities of yours you want to be expressed.\n4) Go to the appointment, start with some small talk and then ask them for it. Usually, they shouldn't deny it if you are a average to good student.", "Ask someone to write you a formal letter of request to request a letter of recommendation, of course.", "The advice on here has been good.  Going in with an outline of your achievements, grades, a work sample, and a general idea of the type of candidate they seek makes it easier to write a meaningful letter.  \n\nSend a thank you note afterwards.", "It's best to ask professors whose classes you've been active/vocal in. This might be a bit tough for some because many people don't like to speak in classes, but professors tend to remember students who had a voice in the class. It's advised to ask them in person for the sake of courtesy. You could ask them during their office hours or any other appropriate time outside of class so that you will have a one-on-one conversation. \nTalk to them about what the letter is for (i.e. I'm applying to X and Y schools, or in your case, I'm applying abroad) and let them know how it should be sent. Make sure to look this up! The first time I asked a teacher for a letter of recommendation, I was so focused on hoping he would say yes that I didn't bother looking up how the letter should be sent and I was dumbfounded when he asked me about the college's preferred method of submission. Most of the time, letters of recommendation are sent electronically but you might need to send via \"snail mail\" depending on the institution's preferences. If it's one of those applications in which you'd have to physically mail it, provide the professor with an already stamped envelope to make his life a little easier.\nIf you have a résumé, feel free to give it to them while asking. This gives them an idea of who you are outside of class by highlighting your qualities and could help them in the writing process. \nAnd finally, remember to thank them! While professors who give a damn about education are happy to help students who are looking to further their education, you must remember that you are asking them for a favor that takes time and effort. Giving them a little thank you note to show your appreciation goes a long way.\nAfter all this, just make sure to communicate with them about the time frame; tell them when it's due, and when you would prefer it to be completed. Follow through with them, pick up your letter, and go along your merry way!", "Dear Whoever,\n\nI am applying for a study abroad program. (Explain the program here.) Would you be able to write a letter for me? (Then give the due date.) Attached is my resume/CV and my transcripts. If possible, I would love the opportunity to come and meet with you sometime to discuss the program in more depth.

You need an enclosed area to just let them run.  Find a local dog park and let them mingle. Be aware as other dogs COULD bite and such,  but usually people handle those well.  \n\nThe walk shouldn't be their exercise. If it is,  theyll want to run. Walking isn't enough for them.  The walk should be the travel to where they will get exercise,  and the travel back home.  \n\nPlus,  if you need to train them,  get a prong collar,  but be mindful of their neck.  Sudden jerks with the leash,  and an instant release of tension should be the proper method to use them.  Don't keep jerking or they'll freak out,  it's meant to be uncomfortable.  \n\nTeach them to \"heel\" and to handle distractions well.  There are a lot of online resources for this,  so I won't waste time typing when I would just copy / paste. \n\nSource: GF is huge into dogs,  training and is very smart about them.", "I used to walk a friend's dog for his mother, she was a chocolate lab mixed with I don't know what, but she was strong as an ox. If his mom tried to walk her the dog would pretty much drag her around until they got home. By about the third time I walked her, she would stay right at my side and keep my pace. I'm sure it wouldn't work for every dog, but I'd wrap the leash in my fist until there was only enough for her to stand where I wanted her to, one half step ahead of me and she'd be choking (normal collar) but I refused to speed up for her to compensate.\n\nAlso if she continued to pull anyway, I'd just outright stop walking until she stopped. Then I'd continue at my own pace until she got the message and matched me. It took some persistence on my part but I was the only one who could comfortably walk her. Also heard that those chest harnesses are good, makes it harder for them to pull, but a I've never used one.", "My friend is a dog trainer. We are actually training a Basset/Boxer breed who pulls like you would not believe. \n\nWe have a harness and clip the leash to the front of the harness. Now when he pulls, it pulls him to the side, instead of dragging me. Keep the leash short and the second he pulls, you stop. You don't start walking until they stop pulling. When he walks next to you, praise him.", "It's called a Gentle Lead. Available at any pet superstore. I can vouch that it worked like magic for the SO dog. Now she just puts the end of the leash in her pocket and he walks right next to her leg.", "It sounds simple but only reward the behavior you are seeking. If the dog is going nuts, don't even reward him by getting the leash on and leaving the house. Reinforce the calm behavior with the reward of a walk. It's time consuming and difficult when all you want to do is get the dog up and out and then get to the rest of your busy day. But if you have the time, take it step by step. Getting the leash, opening the door, and then the actual walk. All of it stops until the calm behavior is exhibited. If there's an off-leash component to the walk, that's when you can let your dog know that going nuts is okay. With me, my dog is completely calm, heals, and easy on the leash. With my wife, he's a spaz because she enables and rewards the behavior.", "I've tried all these methods. None of them have worked for my dog until I got a Sporn harness (Amazon). It pulls his front legs out towards the sides if he pulls too hard, they learn quick.", "I'm not a pro-harness person (I feel like it gives them more power to pull, after all, sled dogs wear harnesses not collars). When you say muzzle leash, do you mean like a head halter? I use one for my 5yo 75lb dog and it makes him incredibly easy to walk (he hates it), but I also clip the leash onto his normal collar in case the snap breaks. \n\nu/wellshitonashingle has good advice, too. With my large dog, I just keep him very close so he doesn't get momentum to go after things like squirrels. \n\nAlso, I've had limited success with a prong collar.

Use small boxes for heavy things: books, dishes, cups, etc. Use medium size boxes for things like kitchen appliances, toys, or shoes.

Out of state you normally just bring in your old license, some sort of proof of birthplace, and proof of residence to a DMV in the new state.", "When packing the stuff from cabinets and drawers in the kitchen, grab a roll of blue painters tape and put tape over any cabinet or drawer that has been completely emptied.

Am 17-ish Need help cos I have fairly bad social skills", "correct_answers": ["First, realize that there's no difference between talking to a girl and talking to a guy. It's a conversation. The only thing that changes is the topics.\n\nNext, A conversation is Q&A. Ask her questions about anything and everything. Build off her responses by adding your own personal experience and/or asking another question to keep the ball rolling.\n\nAnd if things get awkward, ask her another question."], "incorrect_answers": ["Start off with small talk, because going straight into to invasive questions is weird. Ask what she's been up to. Hopefully she'll say something you can work with like, \"just got back from dance class\" and you can ask her how long she's been dancing and how she got into it. Don't be afraid to ask what she likes about whatever activity. It's a vague question, but a decent answer usually shows you a lot about her as a person. If that peters out, you can mention your experience with that activity or an activity in the same general area (\"I don't really dance, but I really like running. I  know what you mean about the feeling of freedom.\")\n\nIf she doesn't give you anything (\"not much, you?\"), try opening up and talking in some depth about something you've really been doing (\"I sent out resumes all day. I really want a job in x because I'm planning on studying x. I guess I'm a little frustrated.\")\n\nIf despite your efforts, conversation seems to flounder anyway, just let it go. It's not always a reflection on your social skills. If she can't think of anything to say and just gives generic answers without asking you anything in return, she's probably not worth your time. \n\nI know there's a lot of pressure to get laid and to \"pull chicks\" and generally form some kind of bond with any attractive girl that walks by, but talking to someone who gets you and builds on what you say will be infinitely more fun than pulling teeth with a girl just because you'll look good in front of your friends.", "I can't tell you what to say but as a general rule- don't talk about your dick, don't complement her too much (once is fine, about everything is annoying and obvious), and if you're trying to get in her pants, don't attempt self-deprecating humor (Unless you're British, then have at it). \n\nIf you run out of things to say, do not talk about whatever niche little interest you have UNLESS you know you share it. It's really dull. I play video games and I am not shy about it but sometimes guys will take this as an invitation to talk about Call of Duty endlessly. I usually try to steer the conversation towards a game we both play but it doesn't always work.\n\nAs a general rule talking about the minutia of a broad subject is best saved for focus groups. \n\nTrying to think about different ways guys have made shit awkward with me. I'm pretty easy to talk to and there's very little that can throw me off- but some guys have still managed it.", "You need to adjust your perspective. She's not an angel and you're not a malajusted retard. Think of it like how your mom explained wild animals to you: they're more afraid of you than you are of them. If this isn't the case, make it that way. Conversation is a pointless veneer that covers up primal mating behavior.", "Don't worry about it too much man, just talk as if you were talking to a friend. If you aren't sure what to say then ask her about herself. If you say something stupid then just make a joke out of it.", "they usually point out how aesthetic I am and wanna feel the striations in my quads and anterior serratus.", "[\"How to Talk to Anyone\" by Leil Lowndes.](http://www.pharmanewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/How-to-Talk-to-Anyone-92-Little-Tricks-for-Big-Success-in-.pdf) Enjoy. This changed the game for me when I was socially isolated and now I'm way more confident. A lot of the tricks in here can be adapted to talk to women.\n\nThe biggest things I learned were (a) give no fucks, (b) smile and laugh, (c) treat people like people. These are not easy lessons to learn but you'll get there. The book taught me B and C and I eventually acquired A on my own.", "My tip, from personal experience.\n\n*Don't have text conversations*. Reserve texting/messaging/calling to organize the next time you can see them in person. You don't need any social skills to type \"Hey, want to grab lunch today?\" \n\nFrom there, others have brought up some pretty good points about conversation.", "Just don't care. Girls know when u care too much or ur trying. Don't try. Be as laid back and uncaring as possible. When ur not thinking of what u should say, ur usually gonna think of a right thing to say.", "Questions,  then LISTEN to what she says, and build from there. I prefer text communication since it gives me more time to think of what I want to say and I can go back and read things so I don't forget what was said.", "Girls are humans too. Get out of the paradigm that they're special creatures on a pedestal. Girls *want* you to talk normal, and not be nervous around them. \"Hi how are you?\" Is a great way to open to a girl. Get her to talk about herself (and listen), and share yourself honestly. \n\nAs for texting, just use texting specifically to organise meet ups. You use manners of course, but try don't have a long conversation by text (unless she seems to want to). Save it for face to face.", "You really just have to do it. Approach her and be friendly. Strike up a conversation about the most random thing and ask questions to get to know her. It is only awkward if you make it awkward.", "You can text me, I'll pretend you're a girl, and then afterwards do the exact opposite of whatever I've been doing.

When someone says \"I don't know what to say\", what they're really saying is \"I don't know what to say that will GUARANTEE me a POSITIVE response from the person\". The reality is you ALWAYS know what to say, you're just putting on a filter and caring too much about what the other person thinks.", "Stop thinking about a girl like an item and treat her like a person you're having a conversation with and it will work. You will fuck up at times. Talking and being social is a skill you need to work at to get better. There is no magic solution.", "People like to talk about themselves.  Ask her about herself.  Ask what she enjoys doing, what her favorite song is, etc, etc.  But make sure you actually pay attention to what she says or you'll go nowhere fast.\n\nThe biggest mistake is to strike up conversation when you don't have anything to say.  That's a quick way to end things.", "I don't like texting my girlfriend because she'll always put \"...\" or just say \"okay\" to what i say to her. She's completely different in person though.", "Ask questions, listen to answers. Recieve questions, give answers.

You could say you don't like dogs but I'm sure that would be a conversation starter of \"omg why not?\" Or more of \"my dog isn't like most you'll see just pet him\"."], "incorrect_answers": ["One of my really good friends told me he 'isn't comfortable around dogs' so I keep mine completely away from him when he comes round. It's no big deal, honestly.  He's a friend, I don't want to cause him any stress. Just tell the person.", "To a certain extent you're sort of screwed, in that you'll probably not entirely get away from the pets in question. As a person coming from a family with ALLOT of pets (We live in Alaska, and have enough room to have a ton comfortably), my mom gets somewhat offended when people consistently want us to stow the dogs away when they come over. I think it feels like someone rejecting her babies (which they are, point here being she almost literally sees them as her toddlers). From here you'll have to figure out a way to compromise with the person who's house you're visiting. \n\nI'm assuming that the, \"pretend you're allergic\" strategy isn't foolproof since you listed family as one of the groups who has dogs you'd like to avoid, so most of your strategy from here will be figuring out how to phrase, \"I really, really, don't like dogs\" in a way that doesn't ping any sort of protective instincts. \n\nMy suggestion, coming from a family with lots of dogs, is to be accommodating, but only to a point. Maybe suggest that they keep the dogs on a floor of the house that you won't be frequenting (we keep ours upstairs since that's just bedrooms and the public spaces are all on ground floor), but that might be harder in a one story home. Maybe dog gates would help. Unfortunately pets are going to be a hard thing to abstain from, but I'm sure if they're your friends and family they'll understand if you try and talk to them about it. \n\nI know that my dogs really want a good sniff, but will lose interest if you don't talk excitedly or show interest yourself. This may sound awkward af, but one thing I have friends who don't want to meet the wave of doge do is bring a dirty sock or something over (I know, kinda weird), and I just sorta give that to the dogs to smell so that they don't need to be all up on my amigos business.", "I don't like being sniffed or licked so I just say no, but still pet them. I like animals just not having one on my crotch. Honestly people won't get offended but there are those few", "If it is someone close to you, let them know prior to you coming. There are a few friends we have that we put the dogs upstairs when they come over. If a dog starts to becoming overbearing or annoying when you're around, the dogs owner won't be offended if you ask. I prefer my guests being comfortable in my home", "As an owner of 3 large dogs and 1 miniature dog I understand why you get questioned when people say \"I don't like dogs\" as my natural response would be to ask why to make sure you're not scared etc.. but where you're not scared of them and just don't like them being near you I'm a bit confused why you don't give them a quick pet and then command them away? That way you're not offending the dog owner by saying you dislike the dog but you're also asserting to the dog and the owner that you don't want the dog near you. The way I do this when visiting others would be to give the dog a quick greeting then verbally say \"alright that's enough now\" makes the owner feel good that you've given any attention to their dog and then embarrassed that their dog is being a nuisance to you. Being calm and assertive is always a good tactic with dogs and their owners, people usually understand boundaries If you highlight them in a positive way.", "Don't visit their home if you don't like their pets and don't want them around you.

I design roads to get payload from point A to point B.  I try to do it as cheaply as possible but have to plan for capacity increases like rush hour so traffic doesn't slow down, accommodate certain routes for oversized traffic, and provide access for critical traffic like emergency vehicles that can't wait behind cars in traffic when things slow down.  Now instead of cars navigating through a city, I do that with data traversing a network.  Your VOIP phone call needs to get there on time and I need to plan for availability for large spikes in traffic that will hopefully come after our new ad campaign.

Curiosity is a learned skill and it is seriously underestimated. \n\nGet him on a fixed schedule. We acquire some habits really early on, so if you train him to wake up and go to bed at the same time, to do things in order and to have a to-do list then it will help him tremendously in life. \n\nLet him watch subbed cartoons and stuff in a language he doesn't know. Kids pick things up crazy fast, and he won't even realise he is learning. Get that 2nd language in his head before he turns 7, it's a crucial time for language learning. Don't make it sound like a chore, but like a challenge. Formal schooling is great, but not the most important aspect.

Teach them empathy and compassion.  This will serve them for life.\n\nRead to your kids.  Get them their own library card.\n\nBe a good example.  Show enthusiasm for learning. Eat healthy and exercise.  Involve your kids in whatever you are doing.  It may take you longer but this is how kids learn.  By doing.  Offer encouragement. Teach your kids about saving money.  Take them thrift shopping and teach them how to fix things.  Volunteer.  Garden. Help those less fortunate.  \n\nBe involved in their education.  Talk to their teachers. Teach at home.", "You have to start teaching them early. Thats pretty much it. It sounds easy, but its easy to slack off and and put it off. If you treat your child like a little person that wants to learn instead of baby talking they will learn. My daughter knew her abc's and numbers and colors and animals and everything pretty much as soon as she could speak. Just because i would sit down and learn with her and talk to her like a person. It makes a huge difference. A lot of parents sit their kids in front of tv's or tablets and such and expect them to learn from that, and they will a little given the right media, but nothing beats one on one learning from the parents.", "Number one - make your kids feel like they are hugely important to you. And you can't really fake that. Spend time with them, teach them to do things they find interesting, make them feel loved. And don't ever hit them or scream at them, for chrissakes.\n\nIt's become apparent to me that one of the great enablers of happiness is finding the thing you were put on earth to do. (there's maybe several actually). Some mix of DNA and nurture makes a speilberg, a stevie ray, that awesome teacher you remember, they guy who can fix any car. Public schools used to expose us to art, photography, drafting, medicine, science, cooking... now it's really up to the parents. But if you find something you love to do, that's valued by society, and you can become proficient at... there's few things better than that. So you gotta help throw all that spaghetti and the proverbial wall to see if anything sticks.\n\n(Daughter just got her master's for free at NYU + $19k/year stipend, not due to \"need\" but because they wanted her back - she's done pretty well!)\n\n(", "Interact and talk with them. Parents these days are too happy to put their child in front of an iPad or TV, and these kids are missing out on the world!! My mother constantly kept me involved, having me help cook or clean with her, and I learnt to talk and walk very early, s well as colours, abc's etc a long time before any one else my age did! I certainly believe it builds confidence for the child as well as personality!", "I cant stress this enough...\n\nGet him involved in sports. Not only will having an outlet for physical activity make him a calm individual at home(as the child will have an outlet for their psycho energy), it will also benefit him physically & psychologically.\n\nMost importantly it will develop a winners mindset. Having competition will teach the kid the most important lesson ever.. that losing is not an actual defeat but a lesson to learn from so that next time it will not happen. one can learn so much from their mistakes. And putting a space for this in a childs life is a great tool to have early on to get ahead in life later. It will humble the child and not allow him to break in panic when adversity strikes! It is a great way to socialise and build confidence. Also being competitive is a great mindset to have in a capitalist society where winners take all.\n\nNot to mention being athletic when he enters high school will ease his transition with dating girls as he will be more attractive physically and mentally because he carries that winners mindset.", "head-start.. are you trying to ensure they turn out *better* than others? That by itself puts an extra set of expectations on their shoulders. Instead, aim to raise them to be 'just as good' as anyone else. \n\nTo see why 'just as good' is better than 'perfect,' you can google Brene Brown.  That being said, u/greenshell 's suggestion exhausts all that you need to teach them: unconditional love, empathy, compassion, healthy lifestyle, financial responsibility, courage, kindness, and being brave to feel and express the whole range of emotions. Doing so by showing a good example and allowing yourself to feel and express emotions. None of that 'boys don't cry' BS. And also none of that 'a girl must be nice and polite.'", "Teach them a love of reading. \n\nTeach them the importance of effort and trying. Not so much innate talent.

Sometimes if I can find an author who is more humorous and/or clear that will draw my attention into the material faster.\n\nAnother technique, is a 12+ hour fast and spinning at the gym with the Kindle version of the material.

What I mean is develop methods to study, memorize, read, and think more efficently.  It might take a few sessions with a tutor who teaches study skills. It might take trial and error to find study techniques that work for you.  But schoolwork doesn't have to be so painful.   I blame schools for not teaching how to study.

Turn your phone off for the 2 hours total you're doing work. The only thing in front of you should be a glass of water, a snack (so you can't use that as an excuse to stop) and your work. You should be able to maintain focus for half an hour at least. Just keep reminding yourself to keep going, it's only half an hour! It's only 45 minutes then you can have a break. \n\nIt's unrealistic for you to get more than 2 hours of work done in 2.5 hours, keep that in mind. It's why we have coffee/morning tea breaks even in the work force, and we have longer lunch breaks (if we're lucky). It's because people just can't focus for that long, and that's during the day!

Does anyone have any tips on how to just get off your ass and achieve something?", "correct_answers": ["Forget motivation - it's too fleeting. Build it into your schedule and just do it. \n\nI wake up 10 minutes before I have to leave for work so I'm only dressed in sweats.

By the time I get there I figure I ought to do something. \n\nBuild it in so you can't avoid it and just do it. Forget about wanting to do it.. That will come with time, but it's tough and too fleeting in the first few months."], "incorrect_answers": ["This is partly because I have the luxury of very flexible work times, but I do two things:\n\n1. Pick a time when you know you'll be otherwise up and about. Habits are hard to build, and starting to exercise is one pretty big habit, so there's no need to challenge yourself even more by having an annoying workout time. Lots of people work out in the morning, but don't feel the need to set yourself a morning gym session if you resent having to get up earlier than usual. If your exercise plan feels in any way like a punishment, you will always find ways of getting out of it. Find times that are inviting - for instance, it might be really refreshing to have a great workout after sitting at a desk for hours.\n\n2. Think about when you next want/need to shower. Going to the movies tomorrow at 6pm and you definitely will want a shower beforehand? Cool, so you had better exercise before 5pm or that shower has not been earned. Once you get a little into the habit of exercising, showering on a day where you skipped the workout is an amazingly effective guilt trip... not even the appeal of clean hair can save you now!", "I keep my workouts really short. That way when I'm feeling crappy and lazy I can tell myself \"just do 20 minutes.\"", "What motivates me to go workout is going on Instagram and looking at the IGs of bodybuilders, crossfitters, fitness models, etc. What really gets me off my ass is looking at (ok this sounds creeper status, but...) hot female fitness model's / hot female bodybuilder's IGs such as Paige Hathaway, Caitlin Rice, Vanessa Rahn.", "This is [good example](http://jamesclear.quora.com/How-to-Build-a-New-Habit-This-is-Your-Strategy-Guide) you will learn that you can't rely when motivation strikes you.

Have the equipment in the house, if you can. this was the biggest for me.

Then I bought two more plates every few weeks. Now I have two 25lb plates and a dozen 10lb plates for free-weight stuff. I was able to do almost everything I needed. I recently bought a multi-station for $250 that does everything, and only takes up a 6x4 section of the spare room. I bought a wall mount and throw a tablet on it and set up Netflix while I'm on the machine. Now I get home from work, finish my routine in ~30 minutes, and I'm ready to eat a bear.", "try having caffeine first thing, yes i know its a bad habit to start but hear me out, the human body likes to live in rhythms and patterns such as the one you're in now, if you break this pattern (and change to a different one obviously) over about the space of 2/3 weeks with regular exercise your body becomes used to it and you have changed the pattern your body is in, also think about when you're eating the night before, try and eat earlier as well as go to sleep earlier which (for me at least) will result in you waking up earlier which gives you more time to get yo ass outta bed and go exercise. Also thinking about the potential hot SO's you might encounter after/during your exercise can help too.", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbkZrOU1Zag\n\nThis, it's shit like this that gets me off my ass and into the gym.

(If your schedule allows, you could extend this to meals too perhaps.) If you aren't drenched in sweat, then no shower for you. \n\nAlso, find something interesting to do while you're exercising. I've really come to like podcasts for this. It's easy to focus on them while exercising, and there are so many options for a variety of interests, you can learn a lot of new things. Freakanomics, 'Stuff you should know', 'This American Life', 'Psychology in Everyday Life', 'Serial' - all of these are really interesting and give you something to look forward to and enjoy while exercising so it's less painful.", "I teach group fitness exercise classes, so I'm a little biased perhaps.  But many people have told me they find having a scheduled activity helps them be motivated.  When you can just go exercise anytime, it is really easy to say you'll do it 'later'. If you know there's a specific time to show up for class and that if you miss it there won't be another one till the evening, or the next day, people have told me they are more likely to get themselves together to go to the class.  And maybe try to go to classes with a friend or two.  Then you will feel like you are letting them down if you don't go.", "Go to a Walmart and look at all the disgusting people. Feel terrible because you're one of them and go out and be a better fucking person.", "do it enough and it becomes a routine.  when it is part of your routine, it is part of your day and the only time that you feel bad about it is when you skip the gym/ the run/ the yoga that you routinely do.", "When I have period of no motivation, I work out in the morning because I can't think clearly and by the time I know what I've gotten myself into im already at the gym doing my warm up. \n\nWhen my motivation is withering there is no way I'll be able to go after an 8 hour workday (and my hellish commute).", "Train yourself to get out of bed when you hear the alarm.  Take an hour and a half on a weekend and go into your bedroom, block out as much light and sound as you can, put on your Pj's, and get in bed.  Basically, replicate your sleeping conditions as closely as possible.  Set your alarm for ten minutes in the future, then just lay down and relax as much as possible. When you hear the alarm,  get out of bed and start walking toward your dresser or closet or wherever it is you keep your workout clothes. Repeat this exercise at least five times, preferably eight to ten. You are conditioning yourself to get out of bed when you hear the alarm.", "To me, wanting to look good is not an effective motivator. It's too vague and self-image is subjective. The transformation is also too gradual to feel rewarding when you go to the gym. However, I work out (mostly strength training) so I can perform better when I snowboard and when I climb. That's the whole reason I go to the gym and the thought of being able to have more fun in those activities thanks to the effort I put in the gym is enough to make me want to go every time. Also, you get noticeable results pretty quickly when you do strength training. I mean, you won't look any different right away, but you'll notice the functional benefits. The added benefit is that you end up looking good anyway after a while (as long as you don't eat like crap all the time).", "This only works when it's cold out, but what I do is keep the temperature turned down really low.  In order to warm up I have to exercise.  Obviously it won't work for someone who is so lazy that they just turn the heat up, but it works for me and I'm pretty damn lazy.", "Subscribe to a fitness plan that has good video material (bodybuilding.com is obviously a good source. Also a nice idea to make a profile there and update your weight, although I personally feel using it as social media / updating every bloody measurement is a bit much work and can do more bad than good). Watching a personal trainer do the excercises like a boss makes you want to try harder to keep up. I personally use Kris Gethin's 12-week trainer. Just remember, you can follow it as intensively as you want (few people can actually keep up with these workouts since they're really intense most of the time), but just the video material helps pump me up a lot. Also, just start with a good preworkout like a protein shake and some caffeine so that you feel like you'll be wasting all that energy if you don't work out.", "Step 1. Be out of shape\n\nStep 2.

If you normally wake up at 10 am, then try not to commit to working out at 6 am. You'll already be in a negative frame of mind.", "Probably the most typical response but I just think to myself, \"If you don't lift you're a wuss. Are you a wuss?\"", "Just enjoy your workouts, than you will WANT to go rather than feeling that you have to. Find something you love and sticking to it will be a peace of friggin cake.", "It takes 28 days for an adult to learn a new habit, do your exercise for 28 consecutive days and I tell you, you'll feel guilty for not doing a workout after the month has come up.", "If it's too hard to get to the gym in the morning, go after work. I do the same thing - every night I tell myself I'm gonna wake up early and work out before work. I even set my alarm an hour earlier. What ends up happening is I get woken up, realize I have an hour before I really need to wake up and go back to bed for another hour.", "I've heard making it a hobby is the strongest way to continue to exercise but I would say if you are REALLY desperate, drink coffee or an energy drink (like an energy shot). Make sure you are hydrated throughout the day, and when you get up in the morning or if you have time to kill that could be spent at the gym, drink some fucking caffeine. You'll feel more like you can tackle the task of going to the gym, you'll feel more confident, you'll feel more like moving and working, and it'll be easier to ignore whatever voice is telling you to stay at home and do something else.\n\nBuilding hobbies doesn't work for everyone. I'm fairly fit but my workout schedule is inconsistent as hell. I can't make myself do it habitually because it's really dependent on my mood and my mood fluctuates. So I say \"fuck you shitty mood\" and drink caffeine to get me pumped up and more positive (or at least more aggressive). Eventually you WILL start to think \"if I miss this workout today I'll be behind\" or \"I want to keep up this good momentum I have going\" and you'll want to go regardless of the caffeine. I hope. \n\nGOOD LUCK", "I think fit happens. Don't do discipline or self admonishing, don't work out out of insecurity or in anger. Find an Activity you enjoy, even if its walking, make a time to take a walk everyday. Don't over do it, if you make yourself sore, or injure yourself, you'll take a few days to recover, then you will stretch that into a week, then two weeks and it will be like starting over. This is were most people do themselves in. If it makes you sore, or its a drag, you won't want to do it, that's natural. Build the activity slowly, so that the increases are hardly perceivable, do it because its a pleasure, not because you should. If you are sore, your doing it wrong. Fit happens when you are enjoying yourself.", "I started martial arts to counter the motivation. You get a schedule handed to you, much like other important things, which I believe heightens the chance of showing up. The fact that a lot of these martial arts trainers are very good at motivating and pushing is another nice thing.\n\nAs for the eating habits.. Try to find something healthy and switch it out with snacks a few times, and hopefully more and more as time progresses.", "I lost over a hundred pounds in the last year and a half through healthy eating and exercise and do not want to gain any of the weight back.  Self loathing was one of the big motivating factors for me.", "I go to the gym at the end of the day with a friend. We have just enough time to get home and change and fill up water bottle or whatever. That time is when people are usually getting out of there so it's not too crowded. We used to go later than that and were making up excuses like the couch is too comfy to go.", "I found this tip in another thread a while ago: Motivation and inspiration are useless. They are based on emotion which is fickle and will abandon you. Instead, replace this with Discipline. For working out, pick a best time to do so and force yourself to work out at that time without fail. \n\nI work out right after work three times a week. I pack may gym bag at night leave it near the front door and throw it in the car in the morning. When I leave work I see the bag in the car as a reminder to go to the gym.\n\nIf you are a morning person then doing this before work might be the best time.\n\nIf you shower before bed then working out before the shower might be the best time.", "I found it really helpful to find a show on Netflix with 9 seasons (TNG, haha) that really wanted to watch, and only watched it on my phone while I ran at the gym. I began to associate working out with watching the show, so I would kind of look forward to it.\n\nAlso, I hate morning workouts even though I feel way better all day if I do them. I found it easiest to work out the moment I get home from work (lucky to have a small gym in my apartment complex). Really great de-stresser for after work.\n\nSo my point is that Netflix helps, and finding a time that naturally feels best.", "I double dog dare you to get up in the morning, go for a workout,  and not eat any sugary junky white starch laden food all day the next day after you read this.. You're not doing it? Don't make me come thru these inter webs and kick your butt. You want those who think you to be a pitiful loser to be proven right, eh? You want that they go about their lives worry free enjoying health and fitness and upbeat mood while looking down on you,pitying you, insulting you behind your back as too stupid to do anything,and giving the comments like \"tsk tsk,pity those lazy of people have to be so completely dumb,clueless and have no motivation to even take care of themselves.\"  You want them to have that satisfaction and get away with it?? Get up and move your body now.", "Do it for three days. It's just three days, motivation can often run for a few days. Once you've done it, the satisfaction of achieving a goal will set you up to do it for a week. After that, a fortnight. And it will just become a habit. And like someone else said Discipline > Motivation. \n\nBut at the end of the day, it's just how important it is to you. If you were in a situation where you might develop some terminal illness if you don't go for a walk, I'm sure you wouldn't need to ask reddit for motivation.", "As unhelpful as this sounds there is no way to get motivated other than to take it day by day.

{"id": "advisorqa-322", "dataset": "advisorqa", "question": "How to help someone who is very afraid of needles (getting blood drawn and shots) overcome their fear? My wife is very scared of needles when it comes to healthcare (e.g., getting vaccines/shots or having blood drawn). She can't even look at the needle when it's just lying on the table, and starts to hyperventilate when the nurse/doctor preps her arm for the shot or to draw blood. What tips do you have for helping her overcome this fear?", "correct_answers": ["This is actually common, people even faint from this. \n\nLet the nurse/doctors know about this personally. Call in advance if possible AND talk to them in person.  As healthcare professionals, they should be able to keep needles hidden from view to lessen the stress. \n\nAsk you wife not to look at the needle during the process and if possible reassure her that it's fast. \n\nIf she doesn't get blood drawn/vaccines often then there isn't much she can do. Eventually she should be conditioned to be more comfortable with them with enough repetitions."], "incorrect_answers": ["I used to have this problem, until I worked in a clinic and learned how to prick fingers/draw blood/give injections. I realized that a huge part of my issue was feeling out of control, because as a child the doctor we went to gave penicillin injections for everything. This feeling of having no control over my own body and as a result experiencing pain traumatized me.\n\nOnce I learned how to do these procedures, I was fascinated by them. I also came to see healthcare personnel as helpers, rather than people who enjoyed torturing me. As a patient, I find it much easier to watch as blood is being drawn. If I'm getting a shot for something, I don't like to be distracted with small talk or silly questions. I have to focus on the moment, accepting and embracing the sensations. It also helps to make the muscle at the injection site go totally loose. If you tense up, the muscle is tight and it hurts more.\n\nIf your wife is open to it, I'd suggest learning about these procedures: how they're done, why certain muscles are used for the injections, what angle the needle has to go in to draw blood. When you become familiar with these things they really are less scary. Also, remind her that she is there because she *wants* to be, and that no one is making her go through the procedure. She could get up and leave if she wanted to! Lastly, don't tolerate rude medical staff. It will make you feel out of control and violated. This is the part where you leave if you have to. Find someone compassionate and understanding. \n\nHope this helps!", "I used to have a really bad fear of needles; now its not nearly as bad- whenever I get shots or have blood drawn, I pull out my phone and play some games, read an article, etc. prior to the shot. Let the nurse/doctor beforehand that you need time to get your phone ready. It doesn't have to be a phone, distraction in general helps a lot. \n\nAnother tip: shots hurt a lot less if you loosen up your muscles- they can even hurt after the shot if you tense up too much during the injection.", "My method is to simply look away while they do the poking for the blood draw or injection. It's usually the anticipation and flinching that makes it worse. Not exactly a fear (not super stressed out), but what I'd presume is the normal not liking getting stuck by something.\n\nAlso it's true that some people are a lot better at this kind of thing than others. Those that work too slow tend to stretch the vein more than poke through it, and it hurts more.", "I'm a fainter, or 'prone to vasovagal attack' as my notes say. I've had certain procedures done with freeze spray instead of anaesthetic. (Nexplanon insertion, for one).  Disclaimer for this, I'm totally okay with tolerating pain so long as I don't have to get a needle, I've been getting fillings done with no anaesthetic since I was fifteen.\n\nIf a needle can't be avoided, there's certain techniques. Firstly, make sure the healthcare person knows. They'll be used to it. If she can't look at the needle, then just *don't*. But distraction is a big feature; she could maybe try practising a breathing m", "I had a friend in the military with a very bad blood phobia. He passed out whenever he got a shot (and we got several in Basic) and even passed out when people talked about giving first aid. We'll, we were assigned to our next duty station together and he actually overcame his blood phobia in less than a year  by gradual  exposure. I've never seen anything like it. By the end we were going to gory horror movies together and he was totally fine. Just slowly worked his way up to it.", "I am one of these people so I cant offer help, in fact I came here for some. \n\nI am getting  physical soon and I usually pass out when I get a blood test. I've tried looking at it, not looking, talking etc. All in all I think it causes a panic attack.\n\nI never had this phobia until I was a teenager. They told me not to eat after midnight and the test was at like 11am and when they took my blood I passed out. I was convulsing and drooling and when I came to I was so scared and confused about where I was, and I really had to use the restroom (which I couldn't because I needed to be supervised) and I threw up a few times.\n\nI guess now I just panic at the fear of that happening which probably causes my heart to race and thusly makes it easier for me to feel faint. For me it really does feel like they are draining my life force and I hate it.\n\nI'm having a kid soon and I know I need to be able to handle it because otherwise I'd be a hypocrite telling my kid that going to the Dr. is important when I am afraid to.\n\nThe one thing that helped last time is laying down during it and having my feel elevated a little higher than the rest of me.
