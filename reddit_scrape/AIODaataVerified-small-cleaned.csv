1,1knon8t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knon8t,Update: Am I overreacting?,"sorry if the title is vague. this is an update to a post i made two days ago about how my friend texted  me to pick him up for school, and after i had drove to where lived, he ditched me and got another ride without telling me. that post blew tf up, so thank you for guys for that. it's not important to my situation but someone at my school, or more like a group of people, found my post and realized it was me, i guess from my post prior to the one this one is an update to (cuz it included a partial picture of me/ my ex gf)

during the time after the incident between me and my friend happened, i told some of my other friends about what happened. they was supporting me, they said my friend was being weird for what he did, and that gave me a lot of security yk. my friends still have my back, even if this dude isnt doing that

but after what he said in these text messages, im not sure if i wanna be associated with him again. he just refuses to take any type of blame for what he did, he just saying he's always been like this, blah blah blah. that doesn't help his case at all either, he's just saying he's always been an AHole rather than just becoming one now. half the people in my last post were saying i had no backbone for not splitting up with bro right away. after what he texted me, i've been thinking, and i think i will probably part ways with him for the foreseeable future. the stuff that happens because of it will be something i have to deal with down the road yk",411,0.94,"[""your friend is an absolute loser who tries to compensate by being a “nonchalant king” lol run"", ""Hey I remember this.

1,1gj4a9i,https://i.redd.it/fx86x622ssyd1.jpeg,AIO - husband playing video games for hours,"my husband has always played video games on and off, but NEVER this much. recently the new call of duty game came out and he plays 5-6 days a week, for MINIMUM 2 hours a day up to 6 hours a day. there’s a few days a week where I go to sleep alone. 

for reference, my relationship previous to this was traumatizing for me as my ex played video games 12-18 hours a day. not exaggerating. i’ve told this to my husband, but he always makes me feel bad saying he’s “not wasting any money” and “just hanging out with friends”. if i can’t think of something for us to do together, he chooses games usually. 

am i overreacting here? do i just need to find my own hobbies? i just feel lonely. and i can’t talk to friends or family about this because i don’t want them to think he’s a negligent husband.

2,1jth2xi,https://i.redd.it/1kdiyo3bqdte1.jpeg,My mum bought us a shed without asking — now she’s blocked me. Am I overreacting?,"Me (28M), and My girlfriend (28F) and I recently moved into our first home together, and I’ve been trying to set healthy boundaries with my mum — which has been difficult because she’s always had a habit of being quite controlling. She often drops by unannounced or makes decisions without asking us, and when I try to communicate openly, she tends to take it personally or twist it.

A recent situation tipped things over:  
We mentioned we were looking at getting a specific type of shed (a Keter one), but without asking or showing us a link, my mum bought one herself and told me she’d be bringing it up and setting it up on Saturday.

I replied saying I hadn’t seen it, and reminded her we were already looking for a specific kind. She then sent a string of messages (screenshot attached) calling me ungrateful, saying I’ve become a snob, and that they won’t be coming to our home anymore. She also blocked me.

For context, she often tries to blame my girlfriend for any decision I make, as if I’m not capable of making choices for myself. My girlfriend has never been rude and is always grateful for anything we’re given — but somehow she always becomes the scapegoat.

I replied politely, telling my mum I appreciated the gesture and that she’s always welcome — but I’m now left feeling anxious and second-guessing myself.

Please bear in mind that this isn't even scratching the surface. When we moved house, my mum wasn't best pleased. It's a nice house in a sought after area, but when my mum saw the floorplan and the dimensions of the house, she said to my brother, who told me, that ""you couldn't even swing a cat in it"". God, I'd love to make a thread of all things she's said that have been hurtful over this past year.

Oh another one, when I was living with my parents, there was a time when my younger brother's girlfriends dog unexpectedly died. I was sympathetic towards her but because I didn't give her a hug (which wasn't appropriate at the time), my mum flipped because of this and kicked us both out of the house and I stayed in a hotel for a week because I didn't have a place to stay. She didn't invite me back. She packed two suitcases full of my belongings and I had to find a place to live. Me and my girlfriend were doing long distance at the time (approx 2hr drive), and because of work commitments, staying at hers wasn't an option, even though her and her family did offer.

Am I overreacting for being upset by all this? Or is this kind of behaviour not okay?",2296,0.98,"[""Man that's awful. I'm sorry.

I’ll make this really short bc there’s tooo much to it. 

Coworker raped me while I was blacked out. He’s hiding behind the mask “I didn’t know she was blacked out” he def knew. 

I made a police report and had to report him to my work because it was unbearable seeing him and he was fooling everyone into believing I was the problem. 

I’m just kinda scared. I’ve always been of reporting a rapist. These r the lowest of the low. He has also mentioned gang affiliation and how much of a badass he is.

My friends say it's no big deal that my boyfriend has a ""little cruch"" on my ""super sexy"" mom ?","I (21f) love my mom (45f) but there have been times where she has embarrassed me. My dad (49m) and I are American and very modern. My mom is an Italian woman who got US citizenship and she has some very old-school ways. She treats herself like maid, especially when guests come over. 

Last Saturday, my boyfriend (22m) came over for dinner with my parents. His 1st time meeting them. Even though my mom has a head cold, she did her usual thing. She spend hours cleaning an already clean house and then spend hours cooking a massive dinner that nobody can finish. 

When my boyfriend came over, my mom hugged and kissed him on both cheeks. She does that with everyone. She served dinner. She dominated the conversation. She was her usual self. My boyfriend was acting like a lovesick puppy. When we were alone, I sniped at him. 

I complained to my friends. My friend group is a mixture of people I met in high school and people I met in college. Both male and female friends. The guys surprised me as they all sympathized with my boyfriend. They explained that they all had a crush on my mom at some point, that it was almost like a rite of passage for our little group. They talked about how my mom is ""super sexy"" but I have nothing to worry about. That having a crush on my mom is almost like having a crush on a celebrity, she's unattendable.

I was expecting my girl friends to rain in the horndogs and back me up but they basically agreed that it was no big deal. Of course, none of them wants their guy to crush on their mom but they all agreed that it wasn't a major relationship problem. 

I feel so out-of-the-loop. Apparently my mom is ""super sexy"" and everyone knows it.

7,1jh5t2m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jh5t2m,"AIO my boyfriend wouldn’t give me space, and his messages weirded me out","For context, my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year. When we first got together, we went to the gym frequently, but over time that tapered off. These days, I go alone, which I don’t mind since it helps me clear my head. However, recently, he mentioned wanting to do more things together, so we made some plans. Later, I brought up how I’d love to go to the gym together again—not all the time, just once or twice a week. He has a lot of free time on weekdays, so I figured it was reasonable.

A few days ago, we were getting ready to go to the gym together. The only issue was that he brought up that he had to meet a friend around the same time, so he was in a bit of a time crunch. This frustrated me slightly, because it felt like he couldn't prioritise something that was important to to me, but it's not a big deal as we can always go another time.

Since I was ready first, I started tidying up the apartment. I noticed the kitchen sink was clogged with rice from when he washed his pot—rice that had been sitting there for four or five days. I had asked him multiple times to clean it, and while he finally did the night before, he left a pile of rice in the sink. Since we’ve had drainage issues before, I wanted to clear it out before we left.

At this point, I was getting irritated. He was standing next to me while I cleaned, continuing to take his time getting ready instead of helping. Then, I noticed his stuff scattered all over the kitchen. I asked if he could put it away before we left—it would have only taken a few seconds. But what really pushed me over the edge was when I turned around and saw socks on the dining table.

This is a huge boundary for me. He has a habit of throwing clothes all over the place, which I’ve brought up multiple times before. Seeing socks on the table where we and our guests are supposed to eat made me snap. I told him to grow up and clean up after himself. We argued. I know I could have been more thoughtful - but I've become less tolerant of this issue.

Despite the tension, we left together and took two buses to the gym. By this point, I was still frustrated, he asked if I'd continue being mad at him all day and he ended up sitting separately on the 2nd bus. That’s when the attached messages started.

To me, it felt like he was bombarding me with messages regardless of what I said. I explained my frustration, but he kept pushing without building on what were talking about. I was really trying to get this resolved before we got off. This wasnt getting resolved. So, I bluntly texted him I needed space and just wanted to focus on working out. It seemed like he agreed to giving eachother space.

When we got to the bus stop, I left for the gym alone since we had both agreed to take space. I knew he was meeting his friend that was close anyway, so I figured it was fine. But instead of leaving, he followed me into the gym.

He asked to use my locker, I told him directly there are other lockers with integrated locks available and he was leaving soon anyway. While I was on the treadmill, he interrupted me to ask again if I was going to be mad all day.

At this point, I was really overwhelmed. My mind was racing, and I just told him to leave me alone. That’s when the gym texts started.

His messages really threw me off—he was apologising one second, guilt-tripping me the next, then victimising himself, and dismissing my need for space. The wildest part was when he threatened to never go to the gym with me again and then ended with ""lmao be stressed"" after I asked once more for space. It felt claustrophobic, like I was expected to immediately regulate my emotions and act like nothing had happened— to comfort him- even though my boundaries had been repeatedly ignored.

Eventually, he ran a bit on the treadmill while I stretched, then he left.

I finished my workout, used the sauna, and went home. I spent a few hours cooking and relaxing on my computer, trying to clear my head. Later, I decided to go for a bike ride to get some fresh air. It felt great.

Then, I got a message from him: ""Woke up to see you’ve left. Not a nice feeling""

At that point, I just thought— do I really have to explain myself after everything that happened? Freedom is a big thing for me, he knows this, and it felt suffocating to be tracked like that. When I got home, I went straight to bed.

I didn’t hear a word from him all day. Later, I headed to the gym alone. As soon as I left the house, he flooded me with messages.

I refused to engage in that cycle again. I thought, why didn’t he bring this up when I was home? So I just told him we’d talk after my session—I didn’t want to associate my gym time with negativity.

I also texted (not in the screenshots) that I’d let him know when I was ready to talk. Looking back, I get what he was trying to say, but completely ignoring my need for space and then demanding an apology felt like too much. I knew I needed to apologise for snapping in the kitchen, but he was hyper-fixating on what happened at the gym—as if I had forced him to be there.

Another day went by. By the end of it, I started the conversation. We talked everything through, I ordered pizza, and watched a show together. He cooked some chicken for me, and it felt like things were back to normal.

But I still can’t shake the weird feeling from his texts.

During our talk, he kept pushing the narrative that I made him uncomfortable, embarrassed, and insecure at the gym—but in the moment, I felt like I was under so much pressure and had no room to breathe. It felt inescapable. All I said was that I needed to be left alone, but he kept engaging with me. He also said the socks were actually clean, and 'they smelled fine' - sure... I'm just confused why he didn't just say that when I brought it up on the day. He said he was struggling while I was taking space, almost talked to me, but admitted he didn't want to be the first one to talk because then he'd be letting me 'win'? - just really strange.

I didn’t straight up tell him I found his messages manipulative, but I did say I was weirded out by them. Now, I’m just trying to get some outside perspective.

Does this seem manipulative, or just bad communication? Whenever I needed space before, he'd become passive aggressive, sarcastic etc... Am I overreacting?

Why? Because you’ll end up holding resentment and/or feel like you weren’t able to get your true feelings off your chest, which has been made evident from your “I still can’t shake the weird feeling from his texts” statement despite you both apparently talking things through.\n\nSounds like he hasn’t fully matured and you’re essentially sick of mothering your spouse who doesn’t know how to give you space despite you stating it multiple times through text and in person.\n\nYou either be completely transparent with the whole situation or leave.

I think the main issue is that though there are words being exchanged, no communication is being had.\n\nHe wants you to come back so his anxiety chills out and you want your space, and neither one of you seems to be even remotely attempting to find a good compromise.\n\nI'd suggest working on finding a good compromise for when handling disagreements so that you can take your space and help him from being anxious while doing so. \n\nDisappearing for a couple hours without telling your partner where you're going, what you're doing, or who you're with can cause further strain when emotions are heightened, so perhaps you can let him know that you're feeling strong emotions and need to take some space. You're going to head to (wherever you're going) to clear your head, and you'll be back by a certain time that you think you can for sure be back by. Maybe tack on another 30 minutes to an hour just in case to add security.

We talk mostly but whenever hes around his friends with me his personality completely changes and he starts being mean to me and starts to avoid me and talk with other girls. Whenever i ask him at home about this he usually avoids the questions or turns the tv volume up or comes up with something else to do as an excuse to get out of the questions. His snap is full of girls and only 10 guys which are his group of friends from his football team at school. He holds hands with other girls and other stuff and then completely changes the convo whenever i ask him about this or usually just says “We’re just best friends”. The thing is he completely avoids me at school and acts like I’m a stranger to him. He ignores me and stays with other girls. I would usually dump him but Ive developed these strong feelings for him that each day grow bigger and stronger and im completely attached to him. I really dont wanna give an end to this relationship but because of all this i think i have no other choice.

she says it wasn’t cheating because she knew the relationship was done. 
I say it 100% was because even though we were going through a very rough patch I still was doing everything in my power to keep us together, took us on vacations, we still did EVERYTHING as a family including thanksgiving and christmas. I still paid a very large portion of her bills and supported her. 

she won’t admit it but i’m almost positive she didn’t leave to keep a roof over her and her sister and her sisters boyfriends heads (they’ve lived with us a little over a year and a half at that point) 

come to also find out that her whole family knew about this guy and no one said anything while I attended family events blissfully stupid.

I told their parents - at church wenddays night after sermon I asked in a very serious tone if we could talk in private i said ""Your childern were doing it at work, I told them to cut it out and havent told anyone else."" his moms eyes popped out of her heads and said ""AT WORK?!"" she quickly grabbed him and they got out of there. Her parents were next and her dad just looked down at the ground. her mom just said ""okay, thank you for telling us."" they left. That night the both of em (coworker's) sent alot of angry mean texts all night long, I had to put them on block. Thursday Morning the Bosses were in- I didn't work till 6 so this is what I heard from other coworker- So the Bosses were in and talked to 19m about ""the incident"" well he was fired. 

I came in at 6 and the boss talked to me about what happened and I let him know. 15f also came in at 6 and 19m had text her about what happed and after she talked to the boss (after me) she showed me the bird and left. Yes? she was fired?
I didn't know at that time. I checked and the mean angry text were still coming. It was an uneventful shift. 

Friday I worked open to close with boss and it was an uneventful regular Friday. at some point the texts stoped. 

Saturday night I saw 19m and 15f and their family sitting together at church and nothing was said between us. 

Sunday after church 19m and 15f with there family behind them apologized to me about overreacting.

25,1monq2r,https://i.redd.it/vn3hz7wr4oif1.jpeg,AIO or is my brother trying to use me to get his GF to forgive him ?,"Honestly if you’re someone recovering from toxic relationships just ignore this because it’s triggering.

But context this pass Sunday my (f15) brother (M19) is in a relationship with my best friend (F15) that we will just call Mia for the post.

But Mia was my best friend before she was even my brother’s Gf…now she’s family because they recently had my little nephew. The relationship between my brother and Mia is very toxic mostly because of him, he’s very controlling and gets jealous a lot, he knows how to control her . Meanwhile Mia is very in my opinion trauma bonded to him because she suffered some bad stuff from her mom’s ex boyfriend…he was like messing with her at night. From what she told me my brother was really there for her and helped her feel normal again. Then Mia is also religious and my brother was her first for alot of things if you catch my drift, and I think she thinks he’s supposed to be her husband and she needs to be with him..so there whole relationship is just mess.

Although the situation that brings me here is Mia and my brother were arguing all day Sunday he wanted to take the baby out to meet his friends and she told him no because she feels like he still too little. But that didn’t stop my brother getting mad  at her and she was like in the recliner breastfeeding the baby and she asked him to bring like a certain medicine to give the baby. I’m not even sure what it was but it had someone weight to its like an inhaler...he ignores her the first few times she asked and he finally does give to her…but I kid you not he quite literally chucks it at her hard. While she’s holding my nephew and this I could tell scared her and she looked at my brother very obviously scared of him. After he does that he looks at her and walks away and she starts hiding under the blanket with the baby crying. That’s when he realizes he fucked up and  starts apologizing to her a bunch. But she kept
Pulling away and just didn’t speak to him she was still obviously crying and my mom did take her home after that.

She hasn’t spoken to my brother since Sunday. I have obviously talk to her and she’s just tired of being treated horribly by him in her own words, “I don’t understand why he treats me this way, I’ve done so many things for him that I really didn’t even want to do to keep him happy in the relationship and he still treats me like this, I won’t allow him to mistreat our baby”
My brother is now been trying to use me to convince her to forgive him…but personally I don’t want her forgive him. He stole her light and positive energy since being in this relationship. She’s not the same person she was before they dated and I feel awful for bringing him into her life…AIO?

She's known for being extremely rude to those on her own shift, enough to make several people quit. She will walk into the office, and make backhanded comments about how it smells bad, or nobody must've done work today since theres rooms written on the board. She has slammed the office door mere inches behind me as Ive walked out of the office. For weeks she would come to departments we'd be working in just to mess with garbage carts, or equally infuriating, she'd stand at the end of a hallway and just absolutely glare at me. I have brought up the off the clock shenanigans, as well as not being comfortable with the way she acts around me or treats me.

Well, somebody ""anonymously"" complained about the hats at work, claiming they looked unprofessional, so one day it said ""No hats as per policy"" on the board in the office. Now I've read the policy and never saw anything to that order, but that's not my battle to fight in the grand scheme of things. Due to that, I o stopped wearing a baseball cap and started wearing my yarmulke (kippah) to work instead. I've worked here for a few years now so I felt comfortable enough to wear it around my coworkers. Boss is fine with it as he recognizes it's religious, not had an issue with it at all. 

The other day, V walks in, makes comments about how it smells so bad in the office, a coworker was showing me something on their phone, and V just walks between her and I like we weren't there. My coworker and I ignored her, then left the office. While leaving the office, I got to hear V telling one of her coworkers  who I will refer to as Kelly,(who is actually quite a nice individual)  ""That's just stupid. That hat is stupid"" I started to walk away faster as I did not want to be around that, I even heard Kelly tell V it was a religious thing, and V doubled down saying it was stupid. I didnt hear much more after that as my hearing isn't great and I was making distance. I messaged my Boss, immediately after the fact as he had just walked in shortly after I heard this interaction. The images show the following texts between my boss and I.

It seems no matter what he seems to defend her, she never stopped glaring at me or making comments. When she was turned in for being in our departments while she was off the clock (big no no) he told us ""Oh she's just the type she likes to get stuff ready early."" I've not wanted to go to HR as I get along with my boss and don't want him to feel like I went over his head with stuff, but I am at my last straw. What should I do? If I was too vague or confusing please feel free to ask me to clear it up and I'll do my best. ",224,0.75,"[""This is a hostile workplace environment. You need to report and document this with HR.

27,1i7vwgt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i7vwgt,AIO by not wanting my ex to send me random selfies??,"So, this argument happened months ago at this point, but it's been pretty consistently bugging me since then, so I need to know if I was actually the one that was being unreasonable here. For context, me and this person had been broken up for a couple of years at this point. The relationship had been very serious and it was a pretty messy breakup, but we tried at least a few times to still be friends. At the time this argument happened, we had just started talking again after almost a year of no contact because of another, different, fight we had, and we'd only been talking again for a couple of days. In this short time span, he sent me at least three different selfies with absolutely NO context. No words, nothing meaningful that was actually worth responding to, not even an attempt to look good so it wasn't a matter of fishing for compliments. I've ALWAYS been the type to think it's ridiculous to do that, and I usually just ignore stuff like that when it gets sent to me and most people get the hint and stop doing that, but I knew that he wasn't going to stop unless I actually said something about it because he does that sort of thing so frequently. As you can see in the first screenshot, he did it to me TWICE in the span of only one hour, and I know that he did it at least one more time before those screenshots.
The reason this has been bothering me for so long is because I sent the screenshots to a few different friends at the time to get their opinions, and while most of them were very much on my side, ONE of them asked me why the hell I'm even talking to him on Snapchat if I DON'T want to get random selfies, and said that that's how most people use Snapchat and it shouldn't be such a big deal to me. I only even use Snapchat because it's what so many of my friends prefer for some godawful reason, but most of my friends know that I don't like being spammed with unnecessary selfies and don't send me anything unless they have something worthwhile to say, and I feel like he should be able to understand if I just don't want to see that sort of thing. It's not like me seeing his face was horribly upsetting to me or anything because I'm over the relationship entirely and there aren't any lingering romantic feelings, but now that I'm not madly and hopelessly in love with him, I just don't find it cute and adorable anymore when he does that sort of thing. When we were IN the relationship, my response to his random nonsensical selfies was always ""awww look at him being all adorable and looking for attention"" but after the breakup, all I can think about is ""okay? What exactly do you expect me to do with this? You've given me NOTHING to respond to and made me stop what I was doing and waste my time just to look at.... Your face? For no reason??"" And of course I've never actually said that because I'm not THAT much of a bitch, but I can't help feeling that way.

28,1l6f25k,https://i.redd.it/g9i29ze8up5f1.png,AIO for wanting to uninvite this guy to a bachelor party because of his behavior?,"A close friend asked me to be a groomsman for his wedding, and I was honored to say yes. Since January, the best man and I have been planning the bachelor party. Because the groom has struggled with cocaine in the past and is now clean, we were careful about who we invited. We excluded some old friends still involved with drugs to avoid temptation and out of respect for the groom and his fiancée.

We did include one old friend, let’s call him Tom, who still uses, but made it very clear that there would be zero tolerance for drug use at the party. He agreed completely.

By March, we’d planned the events: golf, go-karts, bowling, and a night out with a party bus. One friend generously covered a luxury suite ($1,500), and another covered the party bus ($1,500). The remaining 10 of us (excluding the groom and the two who paid for the big items) were asked to contribute $300 each into a “party fund” to cover everything else: activities, drinks, food, and a group wedding gift or refunds of leftover money. I kept everything transparent with an anonymous tracking sheet.

Everyone was on board. One person couldn’t afford it, and another covered his share. Most people paid early. I only had to remind a couple of people, and they paid quickly.

The only exception was Tom. Even though he was one of the first to agree to the plan, when I followed up with him two weeks ago, he acted strangely. I let him know we were collecting money and he still hadn’t sent his. He replied with “I’ll send you your money, relax.” I calmly gave him the details and said we needed final numbers by the Friday before the party.

That Friday came, and still no payment. I checked in with another friend, who advised I just tell Tom that if he wasn’t contributing, he’d have to pay for his own stuff. I passed that message along. In return, I got called a “fuck face” and a “bachelor party Nazi.”

I want to stress: I only reached out twice, politely. Meanwhile, everyone else has been cooperative, thankful, and respectful. We’ve worked hard to make this a great, low-stress weekend, and being insulted like that makes me wonder if we should even have Tom come at all.

i’ve told her this, she tells me i’m just overthinking things. i told her it’s making me uncomfortable, but she keeps telling me i’m just overthinking so i’ve been at my girlfriends house all the time pretty much. i don’t like being around him anymore. 

i feel annoying posting this and im kinda embarrassed 😔 i don’t wanna move out i love my mum but i can’t deal with her around that man she’s a different person and i hate it. i haven’t even been at work i have a week off 💔

You have to treat yourself like you would a friend right now. I’m so sorry you had to endure this. I relate, deeply. Feel free to message me. You can do this!! You’re so young, hun, the sky is the limit!! I’m also excited for you because wheh I left home I really found myself. There is an adventure in this\n\nEdited to add: you may never want to forgive your mom. And your mom may never ask for it. And that’s ok too. Like I said PRIORITIZE YOURSELF. It worked out for me n my mom but it certainly doesn’t mean that everyone deserves or has earned forgiveness, and that’s ok too.

Readjusting himself while looking at your breasts ect?

30,1nihrqp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nihrqp,AIO not wanting to drive 4 hours after how I was treated,"Basically my mom has been getting jealous that my boyfriend’s parents see our sons more (they are retired) my mom works 40+ hours a week. Both parents live 4 hours away from us. I don’t know what to do or say anymore. It makes me really sad because I want to have a relationship with my mom but she is too hurtful. It feels like nothing I do is good enough.

I was hurt all last week because she said they’d come visit, I suggested one thing so she could spend more time with her grandkids and that made her decide she’d just go to our hometown instead. Both 4 hours from where she lives now, so she would have traveled the same distance had she come to my house. 

Then she randomly texts me a week later & acts like she didn’t just do that and expects me to come drive 4 hours to her? 

First text photos are from a time when we drove to our hometown, I told her we were doing this weeks before and she texted me at 1AM trying to make a plan for that day. Thought including it would give you a better idea on how she acts like this all the time and later pretends like it never happened 

I tried setting a clear boundary last night but any advice would be appreciated 

Thoughts?? I feel crazy

She is upset you didn’t spend enough time with grandma, then you’re upset she was only planning to spend a couple hours with you at the park and not your home (which she never actually said). My dad died last year. We didn’t have the best relationship but he tried, like your mom is.

She couldn’t bring her dog to your house and you criticized her for only spending a couple hours at the park with you which again she never said.

Did you stop to think your grandmother is actually hurt because you didn’t spend more time with her and your mom is advocating for her? Imaging being old and having lack of mobility having basically no life and seeing your granddaughter lights up your whole life and she just leaves after an hour. I can just see her saying, “she’s leaving already?” Obviously you don’t want to spend time with her and it’s breaking your mom’s heart and your grandmothers. So anyways, since her dog is a problem for you, she offers for you to come there and offers to pay for everything. Then it’s a no because you were “hurt all week” that she didn’t come to your house? Yeah right, you never wanted her there. When you grow up you’ll realize one of the few people you need to forgive in your life (and there’s exceptions to this like sexual abuse, and it does take a long time to heal before being able to but..) you need to forgive your parents. Go to therapy and let go of resentments. I bet your mom would do a therapy session with you. She seems genuinely interested in being a part of your life and she is trying and she’s not perfect.

Me and this girl tho were never close and I always felt like she didn’t like me but I could never give a valid reason of why I felt like that. Eventually one of the friends in the group told me that the girl told her she would never be friends with someone like me because of who I was as a person (emotional and sensitive), even though that hurt my feelings I didn’t bring it up and started distancing myself from the group. After some months of not talking to anyone I left the group chats and eventually unfollowed the girl and once I did this is the reaction she gave me and before I could even respond she blocks me.

37,1hpver9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hpver9,Am I Overreacting To My Boyfriend Canceling Our 2 Year Anniversary Plans?,"First time posting here but I am seriously in need of a reality check. I want to know who is in the wrong because I'm not able to look at the situation as clearly anymore. 

BACKSTORY:

My boyfriend (M45) and I F(27) met in 2022 when I started working at the same restaurant as he already did. We didn't really talk much but 6 months in to me working there is when he started to show interest and tried to pursue me. Took about 3 months of that for me to give him a chance. After our first time hanging out he told me he had been single for some time and that he was looking for someone to do stuff with like concerts, dinners, vacations etc. but keep it light. Being I am 17 years younger he also said he wouldn't want anything too serious with me since he wouldn't want to ""steal my youth"" or take away any experiences I should be having at my age. I said I love all those things and I would be down but that I thought he was full of it and just trying to spit some game at me. He asked me to name an artist I liked and if I have ever been to Hawaii to which I said yes (he had never been.) A couple days later he booked us a trip to Hawaii but we had to stop in Las Vegas first to go see the artist I liked who would be performing the day before our flights to Hawaii. I was surprised it wasn't all talk. Over that vacation we had a mix of fun and getting to know each other and how we are as partners in relationships to which I promptly said I cook but I am not the best with cleaning to which he said if I cook he would have zero issue doing his part by cleaning and doing any ""manly"" duties. This was the start of our relationship and we had been together ever since. We moved in with each other in 2023. 


TODAY'S ISSUE:

Fast forward to now, I haven't worked with him in a while but he uses work as an excuse not to do his part or the bare minimum. His motto has always been ""quick and easy"" and it's really getting to me that he is the lead server at his job never calls out and people praise all his hard work and efforts yet he comes home ""too tired"" for anything more as if I don't work myself. ""But I work REALLY hard"" is what I'm usually understanding of however that doesn't mean you get to check out. I've seen his work ethic because I worked there and it's amazing I just wish there was some of that leftover for our home and our relationship. He goes out of his way to give co workers rides and help people which I really do love but once he's in the door it's immediately to the couch and what's for dinner.

Yesterday (12/29) was our 2 year anniversary which he PROMISED he would take the day off whether he had to request it off or call out he would make it happen for me. My only requests were to spend the day together and it would be nice if he could make the reservation so I could be somewhat surprised. He didn't feel like making the reservation anywhere and said ""ugh baby just pick one!"" So I made two at places I like. Two days before the date he tried to tell me he wants to go to work to which I was very upset because he's had months notice of this and he could easily request or switch the days off with his coworkers. He asked off new years day but not our date which upset me even more like you could have done both or just chose the one. He realized I was upset and said he would keep his word and that he understands my feelings. The 28th at 10pm I got off work to call him and asked if I should pick up something to drink since we don't work the next day to which he said he was for sure going to work and going back on his word yet again. He said he doesn't feel comfortable not going to work on our anniversary (sunday) but he would want to do something the next day EVEN THOUGH HE STILL IS SCHEDULED. So you'll call out but just not that day? Attached pic is what I was met with. Please help me because this is another promise he hasn't kept and other promises he doesn't keep or leaves them until the last second and then guilt trips me. I need advice 🫠🫠🫠


TL;DR:

Boyfriend promised to have anniversary plans. Tried to go back on it, said nevermind and he understood me, and then actually did cancel. Said he didn't feel comfortable calling out of work on that day but would call out the next day and he requested new years day off when he could have easily requested our day off instead or as well. He has a history of being wishy washy when it comes to his word and we have a 17 year age gap so I am left conflicted.

39,1h8339y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h8339y,AIO/ Ex won’t leave me alone.. do I go to the police?,"Very long story short (even though this is still long), my ex is from out of state, we met when I lived there and I moved back home, we’d been struggling with long distance so were making plans for him to move to me. He planned a visit to come do an interview, but prior to that visit we got into a fight and he lost his mind, I didn’t think he was still coming to visit.. but he did..

This brought out a week-long drunken verbal/emotional harassment “visit” that ended in me breaking up with him and he went back to his home state. He continued to try to call me and text me, I would only respond sporadically through text to leave me alone. 

A few weeks later he told me during that manic week, he did in fact take the job and was still planning to move here to try to prove how much I meant to him and win me back even when I told him to stay home. He did come back, he moved in with a “friend” who lives 6 minutes down the street.

For the last few months he’s continued to try to contact me. I made the mistake of meeting up with him once, in public at a park, to “find closure” because I stupidly thought that would help/work.

Since that day, almost two months ago, I’ve blocked over 5 numbers (which I figured out he can keep creating with an app) and 2 emails (which I learn only go to my spam folder). There’s moments where I don’t hear from him and can ignore his emails going to my spam folder, but last night he was at it again..

Calling me from a no caller ID number that I can’t block, leaving me drunk voicemails. Now he’s texting me from another new number, he just “wants to talk”, I know that’s not a good idea.. 

Unfortunately he knows where I live, but I moved upstairs, installed a ring camera and have two exits to “escape” from if needed. I don’t want to be ignorant in thinking he won’t hurt me, I don’t think he will, he’s never been violent, his word are his weapons.. I’m trying to just ignore his efforts to contact me, I’m not sure what else to do. My therapist and doctor say to file a restraining order, I’m scared it will ramp things up worse… is that the only last option?

40,1oltbmu,https://i.redd.it/c5ccywc2ioyf1.jpeg,AIO or is it weird that the guy I’m dating randomly brings up other women and/or their babies (almost always girls..randomly in conversation both over text and IRL?,"I’ve been dating this guy I’ve known for years. We’re both 30. I got out of my only relationship about five years ago, then had a bad accident three years ago that needed foot surgery. I basically stopped dating until recently. I lost a lot of support from people during that time, but he was always just kind of there, maybe because his parents still live near mine.

Lately he’s been doing something that really bothers me. He keeps bringing up his female friends and their babies, always baby girls. He’ll randomly text me about them, send pictures of the babies or even ultrasound photos, and bring them up in conversations that have nothing to do with it. The one that really throws me off is a friend from grad school (I’ve never met) who had a baby girl three months ago. She hasn’t even let him visit yet, but he talks about her and the baby like he’s part of their family. It makes me uncomfortable FOR her and the baby and I’m not sure if she even knows that he’s sharing her ultrasound photos with people she doesn’t know. 

Last weekend we went out for breakfast and he couldn’t stop talking about how important his job is. He was checking his phone the whole time on a Sunday and bragging about volunteering to work weekends for an extra $150 to $200. When I asked if he’s a workaholic he said yes. He’s a PA, not a doctor, but the way he talks about himself feels strange. I’m not even going to mention him getting two different Broadway tix for himself rather than getting two for the same show for the both of us (mentioned in this text).

41,1npuqd7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1npuqd7,AIO for being rude and indifferent towards my ex who texted me? I can’t help but feel horrible.,"For context, this is about my ex-boyfriend. We broke up at the beginning of August and were together for 4 yrs. At first, things were good, but over time, I found out he cheated with my FRIEND, lied to me constantly, and said many hurtful things. He was emotionally closed off, never fully let me in, and didn't put in nearly as much effort as I did. I often felt unseen and like I had to constantly prove my worth. Safe to say, I loved him a lot. And at many times it felt like he took advantage of my forgiveness and kindness.

During the breakup, we saw each other again two weeks after and I felt like I was practically begging him to give us another chance trying to convince him that I was enough, that we had something special. But he made it clear that he didn't want that. He even said I loved him more than he loved me, which really put things into perspective for me. I respected that and told him that if I stepped away, I wasn't coming back.

About a week later, he texted me again, essentially repeating the same thing he had already said. I reflected during that week and realized I felt the same way he wasn't what I wanted, and he wasn't worth my time. I had been doing too much for someone who didn't care as much as I did. Therefore, I didn't care to change his mind anymore.


Three weeks later (text messages shown), he sent me another message, and I responded firmly.
I feel a little bad about it and worry I might have been too harsh, but honestly, l'm indifferent about him now. I don't care about his guilt or his attempts to tell me my worth because I already know it. It seems like he's just trying to clean his conscience and honestly it took me back be he's very avoidant about things like this.

43,1ltukix,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ltukix,AIO - my friend gave my abusive ex my new phone number,"I am genuinely not sure if I’m tweaking. I used to date a guy about a year ago and this man was TOXIC to a T, stalking, threats, emotional abuse, everything that was bad

He doesn’t live in my country but he came a few times when we were still ‘okay’ but I never invited him to my actual home, we always went to Airbnb’s bc even when things were okay I didn’t want him to have my home address, and when everything started going downhill, he genuinely stalked my address with all the info he found out about me flew from his country to mine and came to my house

That was deadass one of the scariest times of my life, and I genuinely moved after that, I changed my number, I did everything so he wouldn’t come again

But apparently someone I considered a ‘friend’ has for one been talking and for two GAVE that man my phone number knowing damn well everything he did last time

I am so unbelievably mad, I thought I finally found peace and I’ve been healing over everything only to go right back to feeling completely unsafe again, but my ‘friend’ is acting like I’m crazy because it’s been a year and he’s ’probably changed’

It hurts, and I personally don't trust people with important information who don't have explicitly stated support and belief of my stalking. For things like my number I have introduced *harsh* boundaries, so that everyone is aware getting my number is a privilege and not a right. That alone thinned out a lot, because people who get mad at you for this show pretty fast that they don't take the stuff seriously you told them.\n\nIf it is a small help, even a friend who got stabbed by their ex after months of stalking and break-ins, in broad daylight, almost bleeding out...the ex still manages out of *secluded imprisonment with a focus on being mentally unstable* to reach out to shared contacts because he \""needs to talk about/mend their relationship\"" with the survivor. And still manages to get someone approaching the friend over that from time to time. It's absolutely baffling.\n\nTo keep myself safe (and sane), I chose to cut out people who don't respect my privacy and experiences. I'm pretty stern at that and yes it has costed me contacts. Some things told about me aren't nice either because I don't entertain anyone with opinions anymore. For me it was the right path regardless and I honestly don't care for people like this anymore. If they don't respect my safety, I feel like they don't respect me.\n\nThere are a few exceptions, one friend for example always respected my requests and I felt pretty safe, but the day I showed them just a few texts of one of my stalkers, they suddenly blurted out \""I thought it was just a bit of overbearing contact requests, but this is just crazy and scary shit!\"" and honestly, such experiences hurt to the core. I of course didn't cut that friend out and I know they don't mean ill, but it is a wound. It's incredible how little we get actually believed by people who should trust our assessments of a situation. I'm just lucky my family and partner are 100% on my page, or else I surely would have more trust issues by now.\n\nPS: Pay attention to your online footprint. Best to have different usernames everywhere, never share live locations in a public space online EVER, if you wanna share about specific places, only those you don't frequent and only after you have left them. Some stalkers recruit people and knowing your whereabouts can endanger you very badly.""]","{""messages"": [{""speaker"": ""Speaker A"", ""text"": ""??

46,1od0x6u,https://i.redd.it/6fw3aj45zlwf1.jpeg,AIO for breaking up with my boyfriend over these deleted texts.,"This is kind of an update to this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/2FGF4pADNm

TLDR: I got into an argument with my boyfriend after I went through his phone and found out he was live texting my abortion to his female friend, including sending a photo of my sonogram. 

As we worked our way through that argument, I asked him to ask his friend, whose opinion he clearly values so much, how she would feel if she were essentially in my position. 

I asked him to text her “how would you feel if you found out your boyfriend sent your  sonogram to another woman and told her about your abortion”. 

I go back and forth between thinking this is a crazy ask and a reasonable request. I believe she is in the wrong for participating in this and not calling him out on sending sonogram photos if she is such a “girls girl”. But I do feel like it’s a bit crazy to ask your boyfriend to send messages. Idk. 

But he agreed to it. So he said. 

He sat there and pretended to send the text. 

Instead he sent “hi quick question” and when she responded he reduced our argument to me being mad about him discussing our relationship with her. 

I had asked him several times that day what her response was. Each time “she hadn’t responded”. When I asked the next day he said she responded “hey what’s up”, as if she just ignored the whole thing. 

Part of me believed him and thought maybe she thought I took his phone and sent that text and maybe waited for a cool down period before responding. 

Another part of me felt like he was lying. I felt the insincerity. I felt like he was hiding something. I swear I even had a vision of him deleting texts. 

So I took his phone a few days later and immediately opened deleted messages and this is what I found. 

The “omg you’re supposed to delete” and the “I guess so” followed by the immediate deletion of the messages. I was sent into a rage. That was it for me. 

I swear I’m being gaslit now. He’s telling me that he deleted them because he was embarrassed. Because he was mad at himself for even responding to her after telling me that he was cutting that relationship off. That is such horse shit. You deleted the messages to hide them from me. 

I knew I had a bad feeling about this friendship. She gives advice such as “you’re supposed to delete the messages”. What if someone gave her boyfriend that advice? Be so fucking forreal. Always trust your gut instinct, people. 

I guess I’m really just looking for validation here. Because a huge part of me wants to stay knowing damn well I need to walk away. 

",3652,0.96,"[""If he's not choosing you over her now, what makes you think he will choose you if you get married? \n\nYou clearly already don't trust him or you wouldn't have gone through his phone to begin with.

Per your other post this is a guy you wanted to marry and think is wonderful.  This is also not an easy situation to navigate for any guy (not taking away from your more difficult side of things) and having someone he is close with who has experienced the exact same thing probably seemed like an ideal resource to him.

What he did was in fact disrespectful, but there is a chance it was also him leaning on someone during a difficult time.  You found out, he panicked and he handled it horribly after your weird request forcing him to engage about it when he obviously didn't want to.  He should have refused, strongly apologized and went from there.  \n\nThe dude messed up, but if he's been great other than this, I feel like there's a good chance that when the dust settles and the present trauma diminishes you may have some empathy for his situation and not just your own. You may regret this one if you really love him.

I was honestly stunned. Giardia is super contagious, and I have four of my own dogs plus several client dogs here daily. If she had just told me upfront, I obviously wouldn’t have taken him. Instead, she brought him over knowing he was sick and didn’t say a word.

50,1jedoo3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jedoo3,AIO? made a joke about taking a nap,"context: im (23f) a student (currently on spring break) and i enjoy taking naps. they usually go between 1-2.5 (not 4 like he claims i genuinely dk where he got that number) hrs and it’s because i get exhausted between 2-4pm in the day. idk why, it happens every day and it’s been like that since i was a teenager. i don’t nap every single day, but definitely between 3-5x a week.

my boyfriend (28m) has tried to encourage me to take shorter naps because he thinks it’ll help with my sleep schedule. he takes daily naps on his lunch breaks (1 hr absolute max, usually 15-45 min) and he says how energizing they are. i believe him, and i’m glad they work for him, however i haven’t had much success with short naps so i don’t take them.

my sleep schedule has been kinda shit bc of spring break rn and im trying to fix it. i’m usually in bed by 11-12 most nights and up around 8-9. he works a 7-5 so he sleeps at 10 and wakes up at 6. today he sent me this text and i thought it would be funny to make a sarcastic joke because hes always lecturing me about how my naps keep me up at night, then he followed it up with this. idek where to begin with this, i think its weird as fuck and the “we are not on the same level” is just ??? aio?",7476,0.91,"[""\""we are not on the same level.\"" Nice.

51,1l8p8h2,https://i.redd.it/upetgzcvz96f1.jpeg,AIO - I'm tired and hungry,"AIO - just a little background info. My fiance and I both work full time and we have 2 boys. I was out of work for a couple of months due to a medical issue stemming from a chronic autoimmune disease. I'm back to work now (I'm an exterminator) but we are desperately trying to get caught up on bills. Needless to say, money is extremely tight. I have less than $20 until payday and he's not much better off. Yesterday afternoon, I ended up getting a couple of extra appointments on my schedule, which is readily took as it earns me more on my paycheck, but I was working well over an hour from home. 
With money being so tight, I frequently skip meals. Sometimes that's several days in a row. I've lost 18lbs in recent weeks. My fiance knows this and hates it, but I will always make sure my kids are fed before I am. I sent him a text asking if he would figure out supper for the family last night as I would be very late getting home and didn't want to 1) have the kids waiting on me to get home and make supper so late and 2) just really didn't want to cook after working an 11 hour shift in +90° heat. He didn't respond to my message, so I rushed through work to hurry home and make supper so we weren't stuck eating after 8pm. This is the message I received back. I dont have the money to buy myself meals and he knows this. We don't have very much fast/quick stuff in the house, so I would have had to cook something. I figured I would just have a sandwich, too, but got home and found he had eaten 3 sandwiches which left me without bread. I ended up not eating at all yesterday and just went to bed early. I'm upset because to me, it felt like it didn't matter to him if I had food or not. It felt like I didn't matter and like he didn't think of or care about my wellbeing. I don't know if this was sheer laziness. He was playing COD when I arrived, so maybe he didn't want to cook because it would take away time from his game. I cried myself to sleep last night because I felt so abandoned in the moment. Idk why it hit me so hard, but it did. So AIO?

I have chronic autoimmune disease too, and we both know that you need to take care of yourself and eat. He knows you need to take care of yourself and eat. Don’t marry him because you have kids. If he doesn’t care about you enough to leave two damn slices of bread, it is not going to change after you legally bind yourself to him.\n\nWhat if you flare and can’t work because your body didn’t have fuel? Most autoimmune disease sufferers need way more protein than normal people or it takes us longer to heal. Plus you’re working as an exterminator which is a physical job.\n\nAgain, I’m angry and sad for you. I’m glad your children are fed, but if you don’t take care of yourself and your partner doesn’t have your back, the stress will cause negative health effects as well. Him being like this, lazy and inconsiderate, affects your mental and physical health. \n\nI’d have walked to a 24 hour corner store to get you bread if I was your bf. There were a few days where I was flaring but my son needed bread for school sandwiches and I didn’t drive yet, I walked there, slowly and painfully. If you love someone, you show up. If they show you they don’t match your energy, believe them, take off the rose colored glasses, my dad used to say “don’t light yourself on fire for a person that wouldn’t even bother to piss on you to put it out”. My dad was nuts ofc but that saying is true."", ""Money issues aside, (which honestly you’re blessed if you’ve never had at some point in your life)- his actions are not okay. Who needs three sandwiches? No one. No one should have a massive amount of food if they know the other person has none. He’s not concerned with your needs (and eating is a life or death need). Most of us would feed a stranger if we sat with three sandwiches and they had none, so why wouldn’t a fiancé do the same? It’s time to take a long hard look at your life. \nI do not know if you live in the US but if you do, maybe apply for food stamps. That at least can take the burden of food cost away for a while. I’m not sure in this political climate, but I know before a family with two kids would usually qualify.

If you need to run to reddit over something as small as this, you simply shouldn't be in a relationship.""]","[""We use the term breadcrumbing to describe behavior  in casual dating, but the truth is that it absolutely occurs in committed relationships, even when you live together. It's when you offer the other person just enough interest/affection/apology/promises to change, so that they don't leave and you can maintain your situation (playing COD as much as you want when there are more pressing matters, etc.)\n\nBreadcrumbing is basically deploying kindness only when it benefits you. That sounds like what your partner is doing.\n\nHow does it benefit the breadcrumber? They can maintain status quo and the benefits of being with you, sometimes financial benefits of splitting expenses, but without actually having to put in the effort or do the work. And there are children here. This is what he signed up for.\n\nGlad for the update but OP, this will likely be a cycle: you stating your needs, him shaping up just long enough to get you to stay, and then him defaulting to his old behavior being neglectful and selfish. Take this into account as you think about the future you want, because I doubt you will see any kind of sustained effort or change from him. \n\nAlso, what does the division of labor in your house and with the kids look like? I doubt it's anywhere near 50/50.\n\nLook, he didn't just neglect your needs, he doesn't care enough to behave as a partner. We all have our shitty or off days but that would excuse him once. Maybe. But he's seen you LOSE WEIGHT due to not eating, all while you have autoimmune issues and what is clearly a physical job that can put you in harm's way? That's morally reprehensible.\n\nIt's so easy to forget once we're enmeshed in a couple that the most important thing about being a couple is that you are a TEAM and you have each other's backs. It shouldn't even be a question that there will be food waiting for you when you're in a situation like this. He should be figuring out ways you don't ever have to skip meals, like sending you off to work with those sandwiches (plural!) he's always making for himself. He could be researching food banks and nutrition benefits and taking some kind of action to better support his family, WHICH INCLUDES YOU.\n\nThere are so many couples out there in survival mode, but actively improving each other's lives by showing care, concern, and advocacy for each other. Make that your model. This guy lacks something, you cannot fix him and he may never do it himself. So go with what you know. You have yourself and your kids to look out for.

She stays 15 min from the venues where my college events were held..

But anyway, for context, the emergency was abt a diff relative, who is the same age as my sibling. This other relative ran away & was considered ‘missing’. 

I only was just gonna ask my teen sibling if they could check social media of the other kid, to see if that person made any posts etc.. But NOPE! was ‘sleeping’ for 12 f’n hrs.

I get a text last night from an unknown number(ss is below). My Fiance and I have been together for 3+ years. we have an almost 2 year old and i’m 4 months pregnant with our 2nd baby. 

I texted the ss this morning and sent it to my fiance since he is at work and just said “what’s this?” bc i was concerned/ confused. I do trust him and don’t think he has done anything. HOWEVER, he offered for me to go through his phone. i did, and when i got to snap data he started to freak out and go off on me saying “that’s so much data being downloaded, you’re taking their side over mine, you’re letting them come between us” screams all of that to me. so i just let him have his phone back with out even looking and he still proceeds to go off.. 

Am i overthinking now that maybe he maybe guilty or maybe he did do something??

And no, the number hasn’t texted me back.
He keeps saying it’s a scam and someone trying to get us. but why would someone make a comment like that???",15190,0.94,"[""Download the data and have it emailed to YOUR email not his. \n\n\nThen read thru.

I don’t lock the door because he gets angry. I told him to get out and he picked up his phone and pointed it at me like he was taking a picture, which I assumed was a joke until he turned his phone around and there was the picture of me, butt ass naked on the toilet. He said something along the lines of “blackmail, I’m sending this to your boss”. I got angry and he deleted it but I didn’t care, the damage was done. I shoved him out of the room and locked the door. Went and finished my shower and went downstairs to take my meds and ignored him talking to me and went back upstairs to go to bed. These were the texts that followed. The relationship has been rocky for a while but I think this was the last straw and I am currently looking at apartments and planning a way out. He doesn’t think any of this was a big deal. Am I overreacting? ",23507,0.86,"[""NOR leave!
