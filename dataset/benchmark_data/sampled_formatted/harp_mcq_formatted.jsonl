These will be all the possible $p_j$'s.\nFirst, there are two kinds of segments joining the midpoints of every pair of edges belonging to the same face of $Q$: <i>long traces</i> are those connecting the midpoint of opposite sides of the same face of $Q$, and <i>short traces</i> are those connecting the midpoint of adjacent sides of the same face of $Q$.\nSuppose $p_j$ contains a short trace $t_1$ of a face of $Q$. Then it must also contain some trace $t_2$ of an adjacent face of $Q$, where $t_2$ share a common endpoint with $t_1$. So, there are three possibilities for $t_2$, each of which determines a plane $p_j$ containing both $t_1$ and $t_2$.\n<b>Case 1:</b> $t_2$ makes an acute angle with $t_1$. In this case, $p_j \\cap Q$ is an equilateral triangle made by three short traces. There are $8$ of them, corresponding to the $8$ vertices.\n<b>Case 2:</b> $t_2$ is a long trace. $p \\cap Q$ is a rectangle. Each pair of parallel faces of $Q$ contributes $4$ of these rectangles so there are $12$ such rectangles.\n<b>Case 3:</b> $t_2$ is the short trace other than the one described in case 1, i.e. $t_2$ makes an obtuse angle with $t_1$. It is possible to prove that $p \\cap Q$ is a regular hexagon (See note #1 for a proof) and there are $4$ of them.\n<b>Case 4:</b> $p_j$ contains no short traces. This can only make $p_j \\cap Q$ be a square enclosed by long traces. There are $3$ such squares.\nIn total, there are $8+12+4+3=27$ possible planes in $P$. So the maximum of $k$ is $27$.\nOn the other hand, the most economic way to generate these long and short traces is to take all the planes in case 3 and case 4. Overall, they intersect at each trace exactly once (there is a quick way to prove this. See note #2 below.) and also covered all the $6\\times 4 + 4\\times 3 = 36$ traces. So the minimum of $k$ is $7$. The answer to this problem is then $27-7=20$ ... $\\boxed{20}$.\n<b>Note 1</b>: Indeed, let $t_1=AB$ where $B=t_1\\cap t_2$, and $C$ be the other endpoint of $t_2$ that is not $B$. Draw a line through $A$ parallel to $t_1$. This line passes through the center $O$ of the cube and therefore we see that the reflection of $A,B,C$, denoted by $A', B', C'$, respectively, lie on the same plane containing $A,B,C$. Thus $p_j \\cap Q$ is the regular hexagon $ABCA'B'C'$. To count the number of these hexagons, just notice that each short trace uniquely determine a hexagon (by drawing the plane through this trace and the center), and that each face has $4$ short traces. Therefore, there are $4$ such hexagons.\n<b>Note 2</b>: The quick way to prove the fact that none of the planes described in case 3 and case 4 share the same trace is as follows: each of these plane contains the center and therefore the intersection of each pair of them is a line through the center, which obviously does not contain any traces.", "num_solutions": 1, "schema_version": "v1"}, "chosen_correct_answer": "$20$", "chosen_incorrect_answer": "$12$", "correct_chat": "Speaker 1: Distinct planes $p_1,p_2,....,p_k$ intersect the interior of a cube $Q$.

Further, let the perpendicular from $C$ to $\\overleftrightarrow{OB}$ have foot $D$ and length $c$, as in the diagram. Also, let $\\measuredangle OAB=\\alpha$. From the problem, we have $AB=a$ and $BC=b$. By AA similarity, we have $\\triangle OCB \\sim \\triangle OBA$, so $\\measuredangle CBO=\\alpha$ as well.

It must be that $\\overline{AP}$ divides the diagonal into two segments in the ratio $\\sqrt{3}$ to $1$. It is not difficult to visualize that when the square is rotated, the initial and final squares overlap in a rectangular region of dimensions $2\\sqrt{3}$ by $\\sqrt{3} + 1$. The area of the overall region (of the initial and final squares) is therefore twice the area of the original square minus the overlap, or $2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)^2 - 2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) = 2 (4 + 2 \\sqrt{3}) - 2 \\sqrt{3} - 2 = 6 + 2 \\sqrt{3}$.\nThe area also includes $4$ circular segments.

Assuming $A$ is the bottom-left vertex and $B$ is the bottom-right one, it is clear that the third segment is formed as $B$ swings out to the right of the original square [recall that the square is rotated counterclockwise], while the fourth is formed when $D$ overshoots the final square's left edge. To find these areas, consider the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$. Call the point of intersection $E$. From the previous paragraph, it is clear that $PE = \\sqrt{3}$ and $BE = 1$. This means $PB = 2$, and $B$ swings back inside edge $\\overline{BC}$ at a point $1$ unit above $E$ (since it left the edge $1$ unit below). The triangle of the circular sector is therefore an equilateral triangle of side length $2$, and so the angle of the segment is $60^{\\circ}$.

Because the polynomial expression for $D$ is quartic, if it is a perfect square, it would be the square of a quadratic expression. Thus, $D$ could be written in the form $(Ax^2 + Bx + C)^2$ for some $(A, B, C)$.\nSetting $(Ax^2 + Bx + C)^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$, we can compare coefficients.

Setting the cubic terms equal gives $2B = 2$, or $B = 1$. This leaves $(x^2 + x + C)^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1$. We can quickly inspect the constant term to determine that $C = \\pm 1$.

We start by showing that <b>$r$ must also be an integer.</b>\nSuppose not, and say $r = m/n$ where $m>n>1$, and $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. Then $n, n^2, n^3$ must all divide $a$ so $a=n^3k$ for some integer $k$. Then $S_R = n^3k + n^2mk + nm^2k + m^3k < 100$ and we see that even if $k=1$ and $n=2$, we get $m < 4$, which means that the only option for $r$ is $r=3/2$. A quick check shows that even this doesn't work. Thus $r$ must be an integer.\nLet $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d$ be the quarterly scores for the Wildcats. Let $S_W = a+(a+d) + (a+2d)+(a+3d) = 4a+6d$. Let $S_R = a+ar+ar^2+ar^3 = a(1+r)(1+r^2)$. Then $S_R<100$ implies that $r<5$, so $r\\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$.

Reducing modulo 6 we get $a \\equiv 5\\pmod{6}$. Since $15a<100$ we get $a<7$. Thus $a=5$.
