Record yourself. Make sure there is no “tell”. Just walk walk walk slip! Boom!  \n\nDid I mention to use pillows or other cushions during this self training on acting and stunt work? Ok add those. Because learning to fall on purpose is going to take a lot of practice. \n\nAfter about 3000 falls you’ll have mastered the “it looks real part”. Now you’ll need to master the “don’t hurt yourself too bad part”. This will be where we remove the padding. \n\nYou now take your Oscar worthy slip and fall act and add to it a magicians act where when falling on a hard surface you walk away without any injuries above minor bruising. The key to safe falling as we all learned in jump school is… wait. You didn’t go to jump school? Fuck. \n\nOk so let’s go to jump school. We don’t have money so there is only 1 way to get free jump school. You’re gonna have to join the army. Make sure you get in writing that you are getting airborne jump school from your recruiter. It needs to be written into the contract. Make sure you meet the physical and mental requirements as well so they can’t deny you based on these things. From boot camp day 1 to jump school shouldn’t take more than 1-1.5 years. \n\nOk once you have gone to jump school and mastered the how to fall without getting hurt techniques, you’ll need to add this theory and apply it to your fall act. Your first sort of debut will be on base. This will be your first public performance so don’t screw this up. You’re gonna need a medical discharge and a finding of disabled. So you’re also going to need to learn to act the injury. Your injury is gonna be vague and untestable nerve pain in the location of the fall. This will keep you on light to no duty until your medical discharge happens. They have spent about 500k training you this far so they are gonna keep you around for about a year before processing your discharge and disability rating. \n\nOk it’s been 3 years and you are now a world class slip and fall actor. And a disabled vet. This is sort of a bonus as it will increase the value of your fall. \n\nNow you want to pick your target. A well surveilled piece of hard flooring that is owned or leased by a very wealthy company that settles fast. You can almost\nAlways get 10k. So if your act is good. You’ll be making 10k at will until you run out of rich companies or people. \n\nTotal time 4 years. Earning potential after that 4 years of intense slip and fall training: 300k. Maybe. \n\nBut you’ll have a 3rd career. (Army, scam artists, stunt man) stunt man. You are now on a level that will be in high demand. Your benefit to directors is that you are cheaper than CGI. But you’ll make 70-100k a year this way. \n\nI should note that you should be cogent that no matter how good you are at your slip fall routine there will be the occasional error where you really hurt yourself. Thank god you get disability pension from the army. It won’t pay much but it will keep you fed. \n\nAs you get older these falls will have taken their toll. So you’re gonna need a 4th career. Trainer. Now you train wanna be stunt folk on how to slip snd fall realistically. As you talk these new folks thru it you’ll be appreciated for your artistry and peak slip and fall knowledge. \n\nThen the companies you sued will start to notice.

The consulting place never even tried to call the reference #. He did good work, and when he jumped ship he had relevant experience to put on his resume, with no lies.       \n\nIf you plan to do this, have a friend or someone ready as a reference who knows what's going on, list their # from the get go. Do not try this ar any place you really want to work for, or any place you wouldn't want to be blacklisted from. If they catch on you'll never be hired there. Choose some smaller company to get actual experience on your plate then you can start honestly applying for your dream jobs. Prepare well for the interview and make sure you have the skills needed and know what you'll say if they ask for experiences in your previous role.      \n\nI really don't recommend doing this, but beyond putting my # and fake info on my bf's application he was able to just bullshit though it. My real advice is this, if you want to do it honestly - find out what skills you will need to do the job.

The company you supposedly worked for.\n2. The reference you put down.\n3. The experience itself.\n\nNow look, I'm going to be harsh but it's neccesary, if you actually want to successfully pull this off.\n\nPeople who are fresh from University usually have enthusiasm in bags, know about a lot of theories in their field etc but don't know how the day to day operations work in their field. \n\nThey may not know jargon that's only used around certain types of projects, or may not be able to understand how different parts of the business interlink etc.\n\nNow if you were hired by a company genuinely they would expect this, and after 6 months to a year, your enthusiasm and skills would be getting utilized and you would be gaining invaluable knowledge about not only your field, but also the way people operate in a workplace and more specifically how people operate in your area of expertise. \" The way things are done\"\n\nThis is the hardest bit to fake. It's one thing if you've worked in the field and just can't get a job so your going to emblemish things, bit going in fresh is a whole new ballgame.\n\nSo let's look at the 3 points I raised. \n\n1.these days companies do check references sometimes. The company itself will be on LinkedIn and so will the majority of it's staff. If you are saying you worked there you may need that on any profiles you have etc. These checks are part of the background checks companies employ.\n\nYou can choose a company who is no longer operating. That way they can't physically check the references, though these can be tricky to find. \n\n2. Easier. You can simply find a colleague or associate or family friend who is willing to be your reference and pretend they have worked with you.\n\nAgain, if they are going as far as checking these, they may well check that person works at the company you mention or ask for a corporate email address associated with the company. So be prepared to have one on hand, or be able to reference a company that doesn't exist. The best option here is a friend at a company that is real who just lies and said you worked there. There's no real crime being committed and even if you screw up they won't phone the reference up and complain they were wrong about you. An opinion of you is figurative and perfectly acceptable to be wrong. \n\n3.tricky. you need to be careful here. If you say your a nuclear physicist with experience at a power plant, your going to seriously be putting yourself in a shit situation. Because when you get on the job, they will expect you to know your shit. And that is not a position you want to be in. Likewise, if your role is anything related to medical, don't lie. You could really kill someone. If it's finance like me. Come on board we're all at it. \n\nYou want to explain how your skills from there are transferable to this new role.\n\nHow you are fairly new and it was a great learning experience.\n\nHow on top of this you recognize you are still learning and are keen, but not afraid to admit when your wrong.\n\nBasically you want to put experience that isn't too specific or specialized, that if you put it down won't leave you on the first day being left to your own devices because you obviously know your shit.\n\nYou can also choose experience in a slightly different field but the same industry.\n\nThis allows you to say things like \" yes I'm familiar with the topic, but the specifics I'm not too sure about as over at 'x company' we did it differently. \n\nThe. Google Google Google till you know enough to BS your way through meetings. Work with other people and learn from them as you go. Ask questions. Don't try and come off as an expert . Come off as someone with a little experience who really wants to learn and has potential.\n\nPm me if you like I can help you out.", "Unethical? Just lie.

Get ppl who will vouch for you as references. more legit the better.\n2. Put failed companies on your resume. If you get pressed for details just say you signed an NDA and cant discuss specifics\n3. Stay off LinkedIn until you can back it up\n4. Make up tons of stories. Interviewers will want to know examples of times you resolved conflicts, overcame obstacles, and even when you failed and what you learned from it. Use real life stories and just change the setting and technical details, they will work much better. It's not enuf to say you worked somewhere, you have to have learned something and grown from it.\n5. Read some books on mgmt techniques. learn to speak their language. Use buzzwords as often as possible. Simon Sinek - Start With Why and Verne Harnish - Scaling Up are good places to start.\n6. Make the current job on your resume the most relevant and high profile one. Prospective employers can't check or contact your current employer, so load that one up with all the bullshit.\n7. Realize that you are going to fail interview after interview until you learn to say what they wanna hear. That's ok, its part of the game. Record your interviews, develop better answers and stories. Ask for feedback always.\n8. Be confident AF. Never flinch.\n9. If you don't know the answer to a question and dont have some bullshit loaded in the chamber, its fine to admit it or say that you haven't dealt with that before.\n10. Post a fake job that's similar to what you want on Monster or DICE or whatever and use the resumes you receive as a basis for yours.\n11. in your first couple interviews, ask what the day-to-day is like. this will give you content for your stories. See if you can find ppl with similar jobs and grill them for info\n12. Talk about stuff in a way that discourages the more technical questions you might not know. If you were talking about American Football and you casually say that NFC teams have historically had more success running slants and wideouts than play-action, no one is gonna ask you what a Tight End is.\n13. In fact, talk a lot. In a legit, honest interview you want to be the one talking less, but in a bullshit one, you want to use #12 to confidently occupy most of the time to limit the interviewer's ability to ask you shit you don't know.\n14. do the research and write a good resume and cover letter. keep both to one page.\n15. Don't lie about your education. It's not illegal to lie about work history, but it is about schooling. It's way easier to verify as well.\n16. google \"top 50 (job title) interview questions\" and make sure you can answer all of them confidently with a story of how that works or how you applied it in the past."], "incorrect_answers": ["Put me down as a reference.

Think: Lean, Six Sigma, Just-In-Time (these are more for manufacturing/warehousing/supply chain, but the same applies to most industries) and if you can take the time to familiarize yourself with whatever they have chosen to use, it can go a long way in an interview. There are good YT videos available on almost every system out there, and watching a few of them, maybe reading some articles, can give you a base understanding of whatever the principles of the specific system are and how they might apply to the company/role you're applying for.\n\nBesides crafting a believable backstory with verifiable information to back it up, as in a LinkedIn profile, other sites with your former roles listed, etc., having a working knowledge of this stuff can help flesh out a fabricated managerial experience claim. One thing to watch out for, is that in a lot of places, being a manager isn't just telling people what to do, it's dealing with the bigger picture stuff that was formerly above your pay-grade. Interdepartmental communications, project analysis and management, financial reporting and budgeting, and much more.

Make sure you divide this list evenly and buy the things you will all need. Also sort out how you will buy groceries.

When I was in college there were places that rented houses by bedrooms so each lease was for the bedroom and then the only risk is the common areas making you lose your deposit. It might be more work for the landlord so it may be hard to get but it doesn't hurt to ask.\n\nIf you can't, see if you can find a way to draw up a binding contract between all housemates regarding rent and damages. If someone skips out you're still responsible to the landlord but you would also have a way to go after that person to recoup some of it. I don't know how one would do this because I definitely just made it up but I feel like it's possible. Maybe do a Google search for info about it. I can't be the first to think of that."}

It sounds like a cliche, but you know it's true. Good luck, friend.", "This is something I've thought about a lot in my life and I still haven't found the answer but I think I may be able to provide some insights.\n\n1) Fighting who you naturally are will make you miserable. Sometimes that means trying to fit in when you won't, sometimes that means trying to be noticed when you shouldn't. It can hurt to feel like an outcast but it will never hurt as bad as building a life around a lie. You are you. Do what your gut feels is natural and right. The line shouldn't be \"go with the flow\" so much as \"go with YOUR OWN flow.\"\n\n2) Reminding yourself that there will always reasons to be annoyed, but choosing to think differently about them in a way that isn't annoying is better. There is no way I could say it better than David Foster Wallace (nevermind what he chose to do later) in the fun, short video, [This is Water](https://youtu.be/pfw2Qf1VfJo) (from a commencement speech he gave)\n\n3)Create things. I always liked [Vonnegut's](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9a/4c/73/9a4c736085ff7a3fc9e77dbeb5120293.jpg) opinion on the subject but even found some inspiration in [this video](https://youtu.be/C79pemxkf3U) this morning.\n\n4) Don't be afraid to put your wants/hopes/dreams out there. Know in advance that other people will try to stamp them out, but keep doing it anyway. The ones who say \"that sounds awesome, when do we start?\" are people you need to be around. The ones that try to shut you down are lobsters in a bucket.\n\n5) Take care of yourself. I often think of a portion of Vonnegut's *Slaughter-House Five* where a soldier in a German concentration camp was made to wear ill-fitting clothes meant for a woman as a form of humiliation. To say \"fuck you\" to the Nazis, he cleaned the clothes, washed himself, shaved and took care of his body so that he could show that he was not defeated. Eat right, sleep, dress yourself in clothes that fit, exercise.\n\n6) Remember that no matter what, you are not alone. There is somebody else who has felt your struggles or something similar. There are other people out there who feel crazy/lost/confused about things. There are folks who look at other humans and just think \"how do you guys do it?\" These people will understand you when you are in the darkness and will know what to say better than most.\n\nThe rest sort of boils down to the cliches. Avoid comparing your life to others. Know that you are loved. Know that the more you learn, the more you will recognize that you don't know anything. \n\nI know this isn't very well thought out but I hope it helps. Feel free to message me if you ever want to talk. Strangers on the internet are still (sometimes) humans. Peace, love, respect.", "In my experience, the first thing that needs to change is your mindset. This idea of \"finding happiness\" as if it's playing hide and seek with you is a big contributor to your situation. Happiness is not something to seek out or chase after; it's not something that you actively need to subdue to keep with you. Happiness is already there, right next to you. The key is to allow yourself to see it wherever you are. Train your brain. Tell it over and over again that happiness is already with you (at least the same number of times that you told it that it's not there and you have to find it). My happiness revealed itself after I allowed myself find joy in whatever I was doing at the time instead of focusing all my energies on what I didn't have and how that made me unhappy.", "Happiness is an event.. happenstance, root being hap, luck, chance. \"Something good happened\".

Many discontinue therapy after 'trying it' but you need the right therapist.\n\nFeeling defeated and helpless is so damaging IMO because of the 'helpless' bit. First, make a pact with yourself that you *will* fight and you *will* make yourself okay and functional.

I think it's also perfectly acceptable to have a transactional networking relationship, as long as it isn't one sided.

Like, for an IT person it could be, 'let me know if you need someone to optimize your laptop' or something like that.

I have not yet had anyone say no to this. In that time, ask them about when their career started, how it evolved into what they do now, what they like most about it. People like to talk about themselves, and by allowing them to do that with you, they’ll naturally like you more than they did before. As you continue “interviewing” people, you’ll find better ways to phrase a question, or how to properly relate when it feels appropriate. Plus, learning about other roles in my company has helped me discover new pathways for the future!", "I think the best lesson I’ve learned, as a mentor and mentee, is that you should lose the phrase “can I pick your brain?” A lot of people are more than willing to mentor people—sometimes it is as simple as asking someone in a role you’d like to do someday would like to have a quick phone call about how they got into it—but being respectful of their time is incredibly important along with making sure you clearly value your own.\n\nAsk.

Approach the recommender in person, or via email, depending on your situation. Ask them politely if they would be willing to write a letter of recommendation. Remind them who you are, when you had interactions with them (classes, work, etc), what you're applying for and why it's important to you.\n4.

This might be a bit tough for some because many people don't like to speak in classes, but professors tend to remember students who had a voice in the class. It's advised to ask them in person for the sake of courtesy. You could ask them during their office hours or any other appropriate time outside of class so that you will have a one-on-one conversation. \nTalk to them about what the letter is for (i.e. I'm applying to X and Y schools, or in your case, I'm applying abroad) and let them know how it should be sent. Make sure to look this up! The first time I asked a teacher for a letter of recommendation, I was so focused on hoping he would say yes that I didn't bother looking up how the letter should be sent and I was dumbfounded when he asked me about the college's preferred method of submission. Most of the time, letters of recommendation are sent electronically but you might need to send via \"snail mail\" depending on the institution's preferences. If it's one of those applications in which you'd have to physically mail it, provide the professor with an already stamped envelope to make his life a little easier.\nIf you have a résumé, feel free to give it to them while asking. This gives them an idea of who you are outside of class by highlighting your qualities and could help them in the writing process. \nAnd finally, remember to thank them! While professors who give a damn about education are happy to help students who are looking to further their education, you must remember that you are asking them for a favor that takes time and effort. Giving them a little thank you note to show your appreciation goes a long way.\nAfter all this, just make sure to communicate with them about the time frame; tell them when it's due, and when you would prefer it to be completed.

You can set an effective date and it takes about a week to process your request.\n\nPacking: Number your boxes and make an inventory of whats in each box.

Use small boxes for heavy things: books, dishes, cups, etc. Use medium size boxes for things like kitchen appliances, toys, or shoes. Use large boxes for light things: blankets, pillows, clothes, etc.\n\nLicense: It depends on if you are moving out of state or not. Within a state, you can usually just go onto the DMV website and submit a form. They probably won't issue a new license. Out of state you normally just bring in your old license, some sort of proof of birthplace, and proof of residence to a DMV in the new state.", "When packing the stuff from cabinets and drawers in the kitchen, grab a roll of blue painters tape and put tape over any cabinet or drawer that has been completely emptied. We have a tendency to re-check drawers and cabinets over and over, and the blue tape is a visual cue that it's done. Do the same with a room's door once it's finished.

Ask neighbors check on line etc. Don't just assume you will be ok and get stuck with comcast or dsl.\n\nIf moving out of a rental take pictures of rooms as you empty them to ensure as little bs as possible with security deposits. \n\nIf you are moving for work and can't get a place close enough to do anything but drive to work move into a place to the East of where you work. This way you avoid driving toward the sun.\n\nLast thing to pack is cleaning supplies and bathroom stuff. Try to have cups for water and toilet paper out as soon as you get to the new place.\n\nThis last rule pretty much has no exceptions. If you have friends or family help you move lunch is on you.

If done right, you should have a full box of tshirts, shorts and pants, which used to take up two dresser drawers or so.\n\nCords are a hassle to move cause sometimes they get lost.

Don't be afraid to ask what she likes about whatever activity. It's a vague question, but a decent answer usually shows you a lot about her as a person.

It's no big deal, honestly.  He's a friend, I don't want to cause him any stress. Just tell the person.", "To a certain extent you're sort of screwed, in that you'll probably not entirely get away from the pets in question. As a person coming from a family with ALLOT of pets (We live in Alaska, and have enough room to have a ton comfortably), my mom gets somewhat offended when people consistently want us to stow the dogs away when they come over. I think it feels like someone rejecting her babies (which they are, point here being she almost literally sees them as her toddlers). From here you'll have to figure out a way to compromise with the person who's house you're visiting. \n\nI'm assuming that the, \"pretend you're allergic\" strategy isn't foolproof since you listed family as one of the groups who has dogs you'd like to avoid, so most of your strategy from here will be figuring out how to phrase, \"I really, really, don't like dogs\" in a way that doesn't ping any sort of protective instincts. \n\nMy suggestion, coming from a family with lots of dogs, is to be accommodating, but only to a point. Maybe suggest that they keep the dogs on a floor of the house that you won't be frequenting (we keep ours upstairs since that's just bedrooms and the public spaces are all on ground floor), but that might be harder in a one story home. Maybe dog gates would help. Unfortunately pets are going to be a hard thing to abstain from, but I'm sure if they're your friends and family they'll understand if you try and talk to them about it. \n\nI know that my dogs really want a good sniff, but will lose interest if you don't talk excitedly or show interest yourself. This may sound awkward af, but one thing I have friends who don't want to meet the wave of doge do is bring a dirty sock or something over (I know, kinda weird), and I just sorta give that to the dogs to smell so that they don't need to be all up on my amigos business.", "I don't like being sniffed or licked so I just say no, but still pet them. I like animals just not having one on my crotch. Honestly people won't get offended but there are those few", "If it is someone close to you, let them know prior to you coming. There are a few friends we have that we put the dogs upstairs when they come over. If a dog starts to becoming overbearing or annoying when you're around, the dogs owner won't be offended if you ask. I prefer my guests being comfortable in my home", "As an owner of 3 large dogs and 1 miniature dog I understand why you get questioned when people say \"I don't like dogs\" as my natural response would be to ask why to make sure you're not scared etc.. but where you're not scared of them and just don't like them being near you I'm a bit confused why you don't give them a quick pet and then command them away? That way you're not offending the dog owner by saying you dislike the dog but you're also asserting to the dog and the owner that you don't want the dog near you. The way I do this when visiting others would be to give the dog a quick greeting then verbally say \"alright that's enough now\" makes the owner feel good that you've given any attention to their dog and then embarrassed that their dog is being a nuisance to you. Being calm and assertive is always a good tactic with dogs and their owners, people usually understand boundaries If you highlight them in a positive way.", "Don't visit their home if you don't like their pets and don't want them around you.

Curiosity is a learned skill and it is seriously underestimated. \n\nGet him on a fixed schedule. We acquire some habits really early on, so if you train him to wake up and go to bed at the same time, to do things in order and to have a to-do list then it will help him tremendously in life. \n\nLet him watch subbed cartoons and stuff in a language he doesn't know. Kids pick things up crazy fast, and he won't even realise he is learning. Get that 2nd language in his head before he turns 7, it's a crucial time for language learning.

Not only will having an outlet for physical activity make him a calm individual at home(as the child will have an outlet for their psycho energy), it will also benefit him physically & psychologically.\n\nMost importantly it will develop a winners mindset. Having competition will teach the kid the most important lesson ever.. that losing is not an actual defeat but a lesson to learn from so that next time it will not happen. one can learn so much from their mistakes. And putting a space for this in a childs life is a great tool to have early on to get ahead in life later. It will humble the child and not allow him to break in panic when adversity strikes! It is a great way to socialise and build confidence.

Lots of people work out in the morning, but don't feel the need to set yourself a morning gym session if you resent having to get up earlier than usual. If your exercise plan feels in any way like a punishment, you will always find ways of getting out of it. Find times that are inviting - for instance, it might be really refreshing to have a great workout after sitting at a desk for hours.\n\n2. Think about when you next want/need to shower. Going to the movies tomorrow at 6pm and you definitely will want a shower beforehand? Cool, so you had better exercise before 5pm or that shower has not been earned.

(If your schedule allows, you could extend this to meals too perhaps.) If you aren't drenched in sweat, then no shower for you. \n\nAlso, find something interesting to do while you're exercising. I've really come to like podcasts for this. It's easy to focus on them while exercising, and there are so many options for a variety of interests, you can learn a lot of new things. Freakanomics, 'Stuff you should know', 'This American Life', 'Psychology in Everyday Life', 'Serial' - all of these are really interesting and give you something to look forward to and enjoy while exercising so it's less painful.", "I teach group fitness exercise classes, so I'm a little biased perhaps.

The transformation is also too gradual to feel rewarding when you go to the gym. However, I work out (mostly strength training) so I can perform better when I snowboard and when I climb. That's the whole reason I go to the gym and the thought of being able to have more fun in those activities thanks to the effort I put in the gym is enough to make me want to go every time. Also, you get noticeable results pretty quickly when you do strength training. I mean, you won't look any different right away, but you'll notice the functional benefits. The added benefit is that you end up looking good anyway after a while (as long as you don't eat like crap all the time).", "This only works when it's cold out, but what I do is keep the temperature turned down really low.

Also a nice idea to make a profile there and update your weight, although I personally feel using it as social media / updating every bloody measurement is a bit much work and can do more bad than good). Watching a personal trainer do the excercises like a boss makes you want to try harder to keep up. I personally use Kris Gethin's 12-week trainer. Just remember, you can follow it as intensively as you want (few people can actually keep up with these workouts since they're really intense most of the time), but just the video material helps pump me up a lot. Also, just start with a good preworkout like a protein shake and some caffeine so that you feel like you'll be wasting all that energy if you don't work out.", "Step 1. Be out of shape\n\nStep 2.

I do the same thing - every night I tell myself I'm gonna wake up early and work out before work. I even set my alarm an hour earlier.

Make sure you are hydrated throughout the day, and when you get up in the morning or if you have time to kill that could be spent at the gym, drink some fucking caffeine. You'll feel more like you can tackle the task of going to the gym, you'll feel more confident, you'll feel more like moving and working, and it'll be easier to ignore whatever voice is telling you to stay at home and do something else.\n\nBuilding hobbies doesn't work for everyone. I'm fairly fit but my workout schedule is inconsistent as hell. I can't make myself do it habitually because it's really dependent on my mood and my mood fluctuates. So I say \"fuck you shitty mood\" and drink caffeine to get me pumped up and more positive (or at least more aggressive). Eventually you WILL start to think \"if I miss this workout today I'll be behind\" or \"I want to keep up this good momentum I have going\" and you'll want to go regardless of the caffeine. I hope. \n\nGOOD LUCK", "I think fit happens. Don't do discipline or self admonishing, don't work out out of insecurity or in anger.

Don't over do it, if you make yourself sore, or injure yourself, you'll take a few days to recover, then you will stretch that into a week, then two weeks and it will be like starting over. This is were most people do themselves in. If it makes you sore, or its a drag, you won't want to do it, that's natural. Build the activity slowly, so that the increases are hardly perceivable, do it because its a pleasure, not because you should. If you are sore, your doing it wrong. Fit happens when you are enjoying yourself.", "I started martial arts to counter the motivation. You get a schedule handed to you, much like other important things, which I believe heightens the chance of showing up. The fact that a lot of these martial arts trainers are very good at motivating and pushing is another nice thing.\n\nAs for the eating habits.. Try to find something healthy and switch it out with snacks a few times, and hopefully more and more as time progresses.", "I lost over a hundred pounds in the last year and a half through healthy eating and exercise and do not want to gain any of the weight back.  Self loathing was one of the big motivating factors for me.", "I go to the gym at the end of the day with a friend. We have just enough time to get home and change and fill up water bottle or whatever. That time is when people are usually getting out of there so it's not too crowded. We used to go later than that and were making up excuses like the couch is too comfy to go.", "I found this tip in another thread a while ago: Motivation and inspiration are useless. They are based on emotion which is fickle and will abandon you. Instead, replace this with Discipline. For working out, pick a best time to do so and force yourself to work out at that time without fail. \n\nI work out right after work three times a week. I pack may gym bag at night leave it near the front door and throw it in the car in the morning. When I leave work I see the bag in the car as a reminder to go to the gym.\n\nIf you are a morning person then doing this before work might be the best time.\n\nIf you shower before bed then working out before the shower might be the best time.", "I found it really helpful to find a show on Netflix with 9 seasons (TNG, haha) that really wanted to watch, and only watched it on my phone while I ran at the gym.

I realized that a huge part of my issue was feeling out of control, because as a child the doctor we went to gave penicillin injections for everything. This feeling of having no control over my own body and as a result experiencing pain traumatized me.\n\nOnce I learned how to do these procedures, I was fascinated by them. I also came to see healthcare personnel as helpers, rather than people who enjoyed torturing me. As a patient, I find it much easier to watch as blood is being drawn. If I'm getting a shot for something, I don't like to be distracted with small talk or silly questions. I have to focus on the moment, accepting and embracing the sensations. It also helps to make the muscle at the injection site go totally loose. If you tense up, the muscle is tight and it hurts more.\n\nIf your wife is open to it, I'd suggest learning about these procedures: how they're done, why certain muscles are used for the injections, what angle the needle has to go in to draw blood. When you become familiar with these things they really are less scary. Also, remind her that she is there because she *wants* to be, and that no one is making her go through the procedure. She could get up and leave if she wanted to! Lastly, don't tolerate rude medical staff. It will make you feel out of control and violated. This is the part where you leave if you have to.

Nothing online shows that, you have to put in for a call back from the dispatch center to figure that out.\n\nMaybe there's a similar issue for you?

But a few things may help.\n\nStart the conversation with customer service by **politely** saying \"I'm legally required to inform you that I record all my calls\".

If you catch yourself getting heated simply saying something like \"I'm sorry, I know it's not your fault, I'm just upset because this is costing me a lot of money and time.\" can go a long way toward making them feel like they want to help you. Avoid accusatory language like \"you\" or \"your company/driver\", you want this person to be on your side and be more mad at the driver than you are.

Usually, when they talk about how hard the test was, I just nod my head and pretend to agree, and when they ask how I did on the test, I just say \"I did pretty well\" because I don't want to say I got a 99 and sound like I'm bragging. At the same time, I feel like only saying that I did well comes off as snooty. Any idea on how to talk to others about stuff you're a lot better at without coming off as thinking that you're better than them (overall)?\n\nAnother example is for job interviews. I've had about 10 interviews in the past month or so, and my friend has had 4-5. When he asked me how many I had, I told him I had 10 but I felt like kind of a dick for saying that.

When someone gets upset, or even when they don't, just say \"thank you so much for your patience while I work through this. I am a bit new and still learning the procedures\". By thanking them, you are not apologizing and accepting blame - you are assuming that they are being patient, and many will just go along.\n\n2) you are better than you think you are.

Also, when you first start a job, don't worry about speed, that will come with experience. It's better to be slow than constantly making mistakes which end up costing you more time in the end. Don't even worry about being fired, that's more effort than its worth for a company unless you are doing something excessive.

From intentionally misleading scientific research, to massive lobbyist campaigns against beneficial business competition reform. This political cycle there's been more slanderous campaign ads than I can remember in the past yet nothing on issues like climate change. Is there any real way to keep up? Obviously people are going to disagree but the divide, for the most part, seems to mostly separate the informed from the misinformed. It's just becoming more difficult to stay on the side of the informed. Any tips or suggestions or am I fighting a losing battle? I guess I'm looking for something to put a little faith into, and Reddit seem like good people, ^^for ^^the ^^most ^^part.", "correct_answers": ["Look for original sources of information, verifiable facts, corroborating evidence and consensuses from experts in the fields.\n\nFor example, I often see articles posted on facebook and elsewhere with wild claims about some new miracle supplement, political stories that seem insane, or some new thing that is supposed to kill you. When pulling up the articles though, they often make factual sounding statements without anything to back them up, or without listing sources for their claims - a good sign to be skeptical of a claim.\n\nSo, I usually quickly go through a bunch of checks to quickly filter out untrustworthy stories:\n\nLook at the style of the writing or speech. Is it clear, well formed and coherent? Is it written as a factual neutral article, or is is littered with opinion and hyperbole? Exaggerations and appeals to emotion are often used to distract from a lack of substance and fact.\n\nIf there are sources listed, follow them. What are the sources? Are they trustworthy? Is it some persons blogspot page, or is it a well known research institution or respected journalist? Are the sources who they claim they are? A \"scientist\" is not necessarily an expert in the field in question - so a sociologist making claims about climate change, or a geologist making claims about brain chemistry should be questioned. Similarly, a doctor is not necessarily a medical doctor, or a research doctor, or a specialist in the field in question - verify the person making claims is qualified to do so (and that they really exist, look for other publications).\n\nNext, look outside that article and their sources. Are there other places the information can be verified? Public records? Respected scientific journals? Are other unrelated sites or news organizations talking about it? What are their takes on the topic? Is there a general consensus to the facts of the story?\n\nBeware of excuses people make about why they cannot provide sources or evidence. Conspiracy and cover up claims are becoming far less believable in an age where sharing information is easy, decentralized and spread worldwide. So, it's a big red flag if someone is claiming they can't give you facts or evidence due to them being suppressed by some shadowy organization that somehow controls the entire internet (yet doesn't shut down their sites \"exposing\" those conspiracies).\n\nFinally, as others have said, look for motives. Is there someone that gains a lot for spreading that story? Is there a reason they may have fabricated evidence? However, be careful since motive does not disprove a fact, it just offers cause for stronger skepticism. If a politician is making a wild claim about their competition, they obviously have motive to share it - but it could still be true.

It's not about *trust*; it's about investigating the available evidence and likelihood of a claim proportional to the importance of the accuracy of the claim.\n\nFor example, if you hear something on the news that is trivial and unimportant, it's ok to accept it at face value as being \"true enough\". Are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie *really* splitting up, or is that another tabloid headline? If you really do care, check how many mainstream news outlets are carrying the story. If none, it's probably a tabloid headline. If many, it's probably true. If you don't care, just put it in the *maybe* category and move on.\n\nShould you vaccinate your child? That's a life or death issue for your child, so you should put in effort into that one. OK, is it just some pundit and twitter people saying you should do it, or is it recommended by all/most doctors, medical association, health agencies around the world -- generally multiple well-educated professionals whose job it is to look out for your health (and your child's). Sure, they could *all* be wrong or lying, but is it likely that many thousands of professionals around the world are in on a conspiracy to mislead you, are too dumb to question it, or that they know what they are talking about? Who says you shouldn't vaccinate? Is it multitudes of doctors and medical researchers globally, or a Playboy model with no medical training or personally performed research. Is it pundits on cable news? Religious leaders? Politicians? Think about the credentials, jobs, life-choices, and number of people saying you should vs those saying you shouldn't. What's the most plausible explanation, that the professionals are right and Playboy model is wrong, or vice-versa? Put it in the \"far more likely to be true than false\" category. \n\nIf you want to be convinced more, go look at the source information. You don't need to be able to read and understand them; rather, evaluate the situation. Are there many published studies by independent researchers and research organizations around the world over decades, or is it just one recent publication, one person with multiple publications, or a small group of researchers over a short period? The more diverse the publications and repeatable over time, the more likely it is true. \n\nIf you still aren't convinced it's likely true, read the research, or find a professional who *can* read them at a local university and ask them to explain what the studies actually show. This is going a little extreme on the investigation, but if all of the above information is *still* not enough, and this is very important for you, then by all means do it.\n\nIf there are a lot of professional researchers who *disagree* over this, or there are only a few recent studies, or there is little evidence or few professionals who will say there is a definitive answer, then put it in the \"nobody knows enough yet\" category, and maybe 50% likely to be true.\n\nApply the above line of investigation to whatever *important* questions you might have: climate change, GMO, vaccination, health, parenting, perhaps parenting issues.\n\nScale likelihood based on the degree of objectivity of the claimant. Lobbyists, activists, and pundits are not positions aimed at being objective and fair; they aim to present their side as strongly as possible and downplay any doubt to their position. Scientists and medical professionals who are doing science for a living have committed their lives to finding answers through objective research. Individual scientists and doctors can be corrupted or biased, but doing it en masse would mean many have violated their intended purpose and values in life in objective science, and there are amazingly none with the integrity to reveal the mass conspiracy or corruption. Apply this to graduate students too, as they are typically involved in the research of their supervisors and do much of the work that gets published.\n\nThe ultimate tip I would suggest is to change your thinking on this:\n\n> I'm looking for something to put a little faith into\n\nDon't. Faith isn't the right approach. Think in terms of likelihood and importance. Don't believe that something you hear is true or not true, but on a two dimensional scale/grid: on one axis a scale of 1 to 5 (perhaps) from likely not true to likely true, with 3 as \"I don't know\". On the other axis, the amount of effort you've put into it, from 1 to 5 from \"no effort\" to \"much effort\". If some knowing something is very important to you, move that effort scale from 1 toward 5. If the likelihood stays in the middle, then likely nobody really knows, but otherwise your effort should move the likelihood one way or the other.\n\nThis effort can sometimes take minutes, sometimes hours, sometimes a long term project.", "While you make a good point, I'm starting to get suspicious of you and your post.\n\nWho do you work for?", "This is interesting, because I've always had a way of sorting through the overwhelming disinformation, it's one of the few things I'm good at.

All else constant, the universe tends towards the simplest explanation for something. So if you have one simple and elegant explanation for something, and another that relies on you having to make 27 convoluted leaps of faith to get to an answer... the first one is probably reality. \n\nIn statistics... I get really fed-up with people who say you can make statistics say whatever you want. Yeah sure, if you're a moron and don't pay attention to sample size, covariance and correlation of data. In other words how many data points do you have and via math how strongly does your data seem to be indicating what you think it is. Yes, there is math for that. Always look for that. A statistic based on something with a sample size of less than 30 and virtually no correlation to whatever your assumption is is pretty much worthless compared to someone who has thousands of data points and strong correlations. \n\nFor science and medical claims, verify that the scientific method was followed. In other words there was a hypothesis that a scientist then came up with a test case to allow that thought to be proven or disproven, he ran an experiment many times and got data. He published the data and it was peer reviewed by other scientists who agreed his conclusions weren't on their face idiotic and so they and others then ran their own experiments and were able to repeat his test case results, this was done many times by many scientists and they all got the same results. \n\nRead international news sources. A lot of times stuff going on in the American media has to do with the biases of the corporations who run our news.

Initially it was to not check my phone every five minutes, but it also forces you to get your news other places. I would suggest signing up for a subscription to newspapers you respect and who are known for their relative unbias. For international news and politics I would recommend The Economist. Also, support your local paper. They probably need it. \n\nIf you are looking for longer, more informative articles, check out r/indepthstories. A great community. Never dissapoints in their ability to find good journalism.", "You can only choose what to believe based on the evidence you have at the time. The important thing is to be honest about where you lack information and always be open to change if that's where the evidence leads you. \n\nI don't go looking into a lot of things I read/hear,  and so I can only take it at face value. It just falls into a 'stuff I've heard' part of my brain and I'd admit to having no further knowledge if tested on it. \n\nSome stuff I do look into (stuff that interests me) ,  and have enough information to convince myself that it's true.

So from best to last:\n\nIf a newspaper is citing a scientific study, it's generally worth looking at the results. The general media--I find-- generally reports poorly on topics such as science, computing science (esp. hacking and security). An advantage of looking at data, is that there generally cannot be any bias, unless the study is flawed. It just takes a little reading.\n\nLook at the original data on which articles are based. Newspapers  often cite secondary sources such as Reuters or Bloomberg. Generally I prefer to look at these data sources which newspapers cite to make my own conclusions. Reuters in particular has a very specific policy for journalism with the intention to avoid bias and inflammatory language. I trust Reuters to be fairly objective, although they do communicate a slight bias.\n\nLastly, consider your own biases, the biases of the media and read a broad range of articles. There's no point locking yourself in an echo chamber of media which agrees with your viewpoint. It's often worth considering the opposite perspective to form a balanced view. For that, I read newspapers with opposite and known biases. An example would be for example Breitbart vs. The Morning Star. Reading a range of papers with various leanings will help form a broad idea of the truth.\n\nGenerally though, I would advise you to read broadly and use common sense.", "tl;dr of this entire thread: learn critical thinking skills - how to evaluate information and logical arguments to as high a degree of objectivity as possible.\n\nOne of the saddest things about the world today is people have figured out that the more trustworthy something appears on an emotional level, the leeway that source has to slant, distort, or outright fabricate the truth. \n\nDoes this mean you can't accept anything on faith?

If they do not, this is not a good sign. \n2. Determine if the original sources have too much emotional language. Emotional language is a placeholder for solid support. \n3.

Can different conclusions be drawn from the same evidence? This is the hardest to sort out, but requires the most objective interpretation to get right. \n4. Determine if supporting evidence isn't merely innuendo. Sometimes evidence isn't really evidence but implication of evidence. This is very easily noted in conspiracy theory type of arguments.

There are some journalists out there, right? They should be competent in this field.", "Here's how I approach things: \n\nThe \"truth\" is a real thing, but it's obscured in a very noisy ecosystem of different perspectives, opinions, lack of data, and blatant misinformation. There are other systems we can look at that behave similarly, in that if we could have perfect information, we could reduce the noise (uncertainty) and get to the \"truth\": predicting the weather, the stock market, or my stupid fantasy football score for the week. There is some objective, factual truth to what the weather will be like tomorrow, but we basically just don't have enough information to make an exact prediction. We can get close, but not exact. If we knew the energy state of every atom on the planet, the exact number and location of photons hitting the Earth, and a whole bunch of other unobtainable information, we could conceivably predict exactly what the weather will be like. Similar story with the stockmarket and fantasy football. \n\nIn a similar way, the noise and uncertainty of factual information needs to be sifted through in order to narrow in on the objective truth. Now, the examples I gave above are a bit different than finding truth in that they are in the business of prediction, whereas finding truth is more retrospective, but the role that uncertainty, lack of data, and noise play are similar.\n\nFor example, breaking news is highly prone to making mistakes, even with the best of intentions. Things can be misreported, or important details can be unknown, and so on. It's well understood that breaking news is far less accurate than a revisiting of the facts a month later. Hence the saying about hindsight being 20/20. Overtime, the facts are gathered and organized and a clearer version of the objective truth is reached. In general, the truth comes out over time.\n\nGiven this, how can we possibly parse out what's going on today? Or even this week, if it takes so long for the facts to become clear, how can we possibly know what's true today? Well, we can't. But we can make some intelligent guesses in the same way meteorologists can predict weather and stock investors can make money.\n\nFirst of all, being aware of the fact that the \"truth\" is noisy is important. Equally important is the awareness you already have that misinformation is deliberately spread, narratives spun, and agendas pushed. Those things absolutely happen and other people are trying to manipulate you. Being aware of all this is the first step - the second is applying the basics of the scientific method to your truth seeking. \n\nIf we had perfect information, we could look back over time and measure the accuracy of every influencing piece of information. We could score these from each source, and then use that to weight how much we trust the things they're saying today. In order to measure this accuracy, we use further methods of science and the power of hindsight - evidence grows over time, lessons are learned, trends become clearer, and so on. These trends and the growing evidence validates particular current opinions and erodes other current opinions. \n\nWe don't have perfect information, but we use these methods to the best of our ability to parse out today's objective truth. Will a historically-validated liar make false claims today? Not necessarily, but we should be on our guard. Will a historically-validated truth-teller make false claims today? Possibly, not likely. Does the truth-teller have some reason to bend the truth today? Well, maybe we should be a bit more suspicious of what they're saying. \n\n\ntldr - \n\nBe skeptical, use data, take your time, and be aware of forces creating noise in the system.", "Ha.

Generally studies that are taken seriously by the scientific community are heavily cited.  Brand new studies can be an exception.  I also check what sources they are citing, and who is funding the study.  Meta - analyses tend to show less bias and be more accurate because outliers are weeded out.

There is no viable way for a normal human - and by normal I mean someone who's not digging the shityards of the internet and other sources all nights long - to keep up with everything and to have educated opinion on the majority of hot topics. Researching even one area like e.g. global warming will take you months, especially so if you don't have tech background.\n\nSee, the more controversial the topic is (and you mentioned climate change and politics) and the more money and power is on the line, the more advanced manipulation techniques will be applied by all parties involved. I listened the intrudocutory course to \"Information Warfare\" (don't know the exact English term for it) and on the very first lection professor told that there is no way one can fully resist the manipulation in media even if he delibetary tries to dig for the truth and avoid biased opinions.\n\nThe extreme example here is trying to understand geopolitical decisions. Without inside information it's literally impossible no matter the efforts because the amount of sources is overwhelming, they are contradictory and they yield the information at a higher pace then one can absorb. Also, due to a huge amount of [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) one has to check each of them during reading which is very exhaustive.\n\nKeeping in mind all the above, I'd say:\n * Don't try to work out detailed views on political and geopolitical subjects and on everything on Earth, don't try to keep up with everything.\n\n * Never-ever-ever watch TV!\n\n * Read the most non-opinionated, time-proven and fundamental scientific literature on the subject you are interested in. E.g. for politics it will be some classical works on history, sociology and economy which will give you the ground for estimating where particular actions lead and hence what's the reasoning behind them.\n\n * Read sources from all the spectrum of opinions and try think critically about them - this a separate trainable skill. Also, it's safe to completely ignore known yellow journalism sources like Russia Today or Fox News. They give you nothing but manipulation which is hard to resist.\n\n * Relax. There is absolutely no benefit in the knowledge on the majority of topics. Knowing who's the baddest asshole in Siria gives you nothing. Read the books you enjoy which don't try to shove a load of crap in your head.\n\nSorry for my English.", "1) Peer reviewed studies, especially literature reviews (which is basically going over all the studies you can get and drawing a general conclusion about what's said in them). If you can, use a library to access these, as they pay for full access to huge databases. If not, there are still several public access databases (my favorite is the US NIH's PubMed). Failing that, most places will show you the introductory summary, called an abstract. This is the cover blurb of science, except it gives away the whole thing as briefly as possible. **Peer review** from a **reputable scholarly source** the essential component here. If it is not open to critique from other scientists and offered up to the community for corroborative purposes, there is likely a reason. If you're looking for pure theory, think tanks *can* be OK, but see my next point.\n\n2) Evaluate for bias and use multiple sources. Figure out who has what kind of skin in the game. Then, find someone with a different kind. There is the fact of what happens, but nobody sees truth - only their version of it (watch *Rashomon* for a damn good perspective on this). There may be some truth in everyone's story, or lies. CNN says one thing, the *Guardian* another, Al-Jazeera a third... National news organizations like the BBC and NHK will generally be favorable to who runs the government. Al-Jazeera is beholden to its Gulf emir donors. And so forth. If you look at multiple perspectives, especially those that conflict, you can often derive some factual knowledge and make a better conclusion. I'm personally a fan of \"news wire\" services like the Associated Press, as well as local news. They tend to provide the bare minimum on breaking news as it occurs. That said they've got skin in the game, too. In science, remember that funding is key, especially in state sponsored studies. The social sciences are especially prone to bias, since human behavior makes us terrible subjects and the issues are very politically charged. The FBI's excellent criminological work has the secondary purpose of keeping the Bureau going. Economic statistics will be manipulated by the powers that be - for example, the U.S. \"market basket\" of groceries used to determine purchasing power changes frequently, and the poverty line assumes that the family has a full-time homemaker.  \n\n3) \"See the [fnords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fnord?wprov=sfla1). This is a corollary to #2 really. Fear sells. Advertising works on insecurity, and keeping the population anxious means they will cling strongly to the leaders of their choice, established or no. This is the main trouble with news, even local sources - to sell, they need to use a sensational tone that keeps people wanting more. On top of that, governments will seek to influence the media to serve their interests. A lot of the time, this involves turning boring events into \"maybe terrorism,\" showing interviews with the person on the street who saw nothing, but is scared nonetheless. You are supposed to be afraid. Always look to see how people are spinning this into the story.\n\n4) reputable sources. For example, while the Christian Science Monitor might disapprove of modern medicine, they often provide a less partisan view of major sociopolitical issues. The New York Times is the USA's foremost paper because it has a long standing reputation as a provider of good information. The National Enquirer is a joke and is not to be believed. USA Today is simplistic, the Daily Mail is a sensationalist rag that exists to sell copies. Regardless, always check for bias. Skin in the game.\n\nAssassin's Creed got it right: \"Nothing is true; everything is permitted.\" A single point from an arbitrary source is a tool of who shares it.

Schedule out every day what you need to work on. And STICK WITH IT (the hardest part for both of us it seems ☺)! Schedule a unit this week, the next unit the week after, on Fridays review, etc. (Scheduling  review period during each study session is ideal too). Schedule it down to the hour if need be. In the future, you can start this strategy as soon as you get the syllabus for the semester. \n\n- Use a timer to keep you on track during study sessions. With the timer, you can also incorporate study breaks (time those too!).", "* Pick a topic you enjoy studying.\n\nStudy it first.\n\n* Repeat with other topics.\n\nIt'll make you enjoy your studying and hopefully make it more fun.\n\n* Think of studying as video game achievements, and make sure they're close to each other.\n\nLet's say you have a 100 pages book.

I would put all the information into quizlet or note cards and power through them. Removing the ones I do know and keep cycling through the ones I don't.

I took a course from UC Berkeley called \"Learning How to Learn\" and here's what I learned:\n\n * Your brain forms memories while trying to recall them. Make flash cards of important concepts as you learn them. Right after reading a new concept, write it on a flash card, close the book, and quiz yourself. After your study session, quiz yourself. Even if you can't remember and have to look at the answer, just TRYING to recall will build new neural synapses (ability to recall later).\n * Learning new concepts (Diffused Learning) works best in small sessions with a mental break in between. Read something really quick before your commute, then nap, and your brain will process subconsciously while you sleep. When you reach your destination, try to recall what you read and then look up anything that you can't remember.\n * Longer study sessions (focused learning) is better for something you understand and just need to practice.\n\nThese tips shouldn't take more time, they're just different ways of using your brain during your study session that are more efficient use of your limited time.", "I can't speak about effective study habits per se, because I'm also a serial procrastinator, but here are some METHODS of studying that are generally highly effective. \n\nTake notes, and do them right. Don't just write down what the teacher says, summarize what they say in your own words. If you can't do this during the lesson (though you really should learn to its immensely helpful), just write everything down. Make sure to leave space along the margin (enough to write a couple sentences) and along the bottom of the page (typically 1/6th to 1:5th of the page, I think). Next at some point after having written the notes, ON THE SAME DAY (can't stress this enough, it is way less effective if you wait), go over the notes and, along the bottom in the space you elect, summarize each page of notes into what you think is important. This is super useful because now you don't have to read an entire page of notes every time you study, you can just read your summary and you'll likely remember what's on the page because it's your interpretation of the notes. Next, along the margin, write down 3-5 study questions, questions you think a teacher would put on an exam to make sure you knew the material. Ones that make you think are best but even just asking for definitions is fine, as long as they make you think about it. Once you've done this, go over these summaries and answer the study questions (try to without looking at the notes of course) first once a day or so for a couple days, then once a week, then once a month just to remind yourself and when exam time comes, go over the notes, maybe try and think of new questions that might be asked and answer those. \n\nNow, this is a great strategy if you do it from start to finish. Obviously, you haven't done it. So in that case, I would suggest either getting someone else's notes (if you have your own that's fine too), or if you don't have them, go through the text book and write your notes from there. Do the same thing I wrote above, and you should get a solid understanding of the material. If your teacher has PowerPoint slides, get those and use those as well. This will generally be less effective because you won't have the teacher's explainations when you're summarizing but it's better than nothing. \n\nIn terms of WHEN it's best to review, it's actually best to read the summaries sometime before you go to sleep. This is because of a couple different things. First: when you learn something or read something, you can keep it in your mind fairly well, but while time passes, you continuously gain new information in your brain and that starts messing with the information you learned before. This happens automatically, to everyone, don't worry too much about it. Secondly, when you sleep, your brain can start the real memorization process, which makes the stuff you learned stick way more solidly in your mind, meaning it won't degrade nearly as much when time passes. Therefore, you want to have the information in your head be as unaffected by time as possible before you go to sleep, where it will get locked down into your brain.\n\nSo basically, take notes like I described, summarize them on that day, review them relatively frequently and before exams, sometime around the time you go to sleep, and you'll have a much easier time remembering stuff. \n\nI have other stuff that can help memorization and I can share them if you really want but for the most part it would be best to stick to one solid strategy and do it well. \n\nOh, and if you know how to use mind maps, those things are the shit!\n\nHope things work out for you, mate! Don't get lost and remember, don't get too stressed out. \n\nSource: university workshop on effective study strategies and a 2nd year psychology course on memory and cognition. \n\n:(", "Hey buddy I know where you're at, and this may sound like shit advice but you have to believe in yourself. It sounds like you have developed a way of thinking of yourself as being this lazy, not smart, unhappy, struggling person and as long as you truly believe that about yourself you will subconsciously return to it and solidify it. It sounds like you are already breaking the mold by striving for betterment, it just takes willpower and dedication to keep pushing. As far as studying goes I suggest trying to study for 20 minutes then taking a 10 minute break then returning for another 20 and loop it, but as far as depression that's a change that had to come from within you.

His advice was to work while taking community college classes, then transfer when you can finish your degree in 18-24 months.

Additionally, since community colleges tend to be less rigorous academically than 4 year schools, you have the opportunity to graduate with a 4.0 as a pretty reachable goal. If you get straight A's there is a possibility you could get a scholarship for the final two years at University. Also, you could work at the same time thus graduating with much less debt.

Yeah, pretend that this is how your ears work, imagine, when somebody speaks to you, their individual words bouncing off parts of your ear, and being filtered in, really try to pick up on where the noise is coming from exactly, how nasal/glottal they sound, their tone, this will not only make you seem interested and become engaged in conversation but you'll become a lot more alert with minimal effort as long as you make it a habit. People will put aside time to talk to you because you're now a fucking great listener, and people are selfish.\n\n- Eye contact, this isn't the easiest for most of us, but try looking directly between someones eyes when you/they speak, this way, people know you are speaking directly to them, no matter how shy you are, you will appear direct, it's always best to do this with a warm smile and a calm gaze so as to not seem too confrontational.\n\n- This is super important. Make sure your words have weight, visualise what you're saying, how would this make the most emotional man in the world react? Give your words belief and value and the emotion will come, you have to believe in what you're saying before anyone else will.\n\n- Silence, one of the best tools a good speaker will use, avoid \"umm, like, yeah so\" and replace with silence, you filter out your own background noise and give your listeners a chance to consolidate what you have just said, albeit a small break of 1-2 seconds, that's all the brain needs. You'll also get cut off a lot less because people will subconsciously pick up on this manner of speech as importance (In Shakespeare, the higher class a character is, the more pauses they take, it's for good reason)\n\n- You're also born with a pair of hands, these are fantastic tools for speech when you really need to bring a point home or emphasise something, you don't need to stretch your voice far, as long as you can convey your feeling kinetically.\n\n- Lastly, volume and timbre, you don't have to be loud to be heard! You don't have to be all over the place with your tone! Stephen Hawking speaks in 4/5 tones (probably about 10 times less than the average person) and yet people would kill to hear what he has to say.

Most likely, it's the release agent used during manufacturing.  It can be pretty tough to get out.  Here's what you need to do:\n\n- Get an old toothbrush and some PASTE style toothpaste.

When you think you've scrubbed it enough, scrub it some more.\n\n- Clean all of the toothpaste off the lenses.

Just hold it in the cold water to chill the glass.\n\n- Pick it up and exhale the hottest, warmest breath you can into the mask.  Do you see any fogged areas?  If so, scrub those again and repeat the breath test.\n\nThis will work about 95% of the time.  If the mask continues to fog no matter how much scrubbing you do, you'll need to resort to a more drastic fix.\n\n- You'll need a cigarette lighter.\n\n- The idea here is to burn the coating off the inside of the mask since it won't scrub off.\n\n- Hold the mask so it's right over the lighter.  Light it and quickly lick the flame around the inside of the lens.  Keep the lens moving at all times.

Afterwards we laid down on my couch just looking in each others eyes, and after a while I kissed her and told her that I loved her and she said she loved me too. I didn't really decide to kiss her its just what happed cus it felt so natural. We've been a thing ever since and have a great relationship, and I'm so glad I kissed her because if I didn't then I'd always be wondering how things could have been different.

If it doesn't, however...\n\nYou'll need to get her to like you that way first, before any kind of confession has a chance to work. Start by slowly introducing non-threatening \"dating\" actions into your regular hangouts, such as gentlemanly actions (pulling her chair out for her, etc). This clues her in that something's different, yet isn't too far past the line that she might react adversely... unless she's really, really not into you beyond friendship.\n\nThen slowly work your way closer and closer, as long as she doesn't push you away.

Then and only then, do you confess for maximum chances.\n\nThe key here is to be patient and not rush the process. It has to happen organically, just with a little nudging on your side. She has to be comfortable with the increasing closeness at every stage. If at some point you find her distancing herself, you've either gone too fast or you never stood a chance to begin with.\n\nOf course, the more physically attractive you are, the easier it is for you to do this.

I should preface this by saying that I'm 14 years old.\n\nThe other day my mom noticed that my mouth moves weirdly when I talk. I don't know how to describe it, but sorta only my lips move and my jaw and stuff don't really move along with it? I dunno, it's weird.\n\nThen, sometimes, I noticed, like when she's driving, she'd randomly turn to me and start laughing when I was in the middle of talking to her. I asked her what was happening and she was like \"I'm just looking at how you talk,\" and I immediately remembered that.\n\nThen one day she was like to me \"sometimes you talk normal, sometimes you don't move your jaw and stuff.\" I was like \"ok\" and then she said \"you do it only when you're thinking about it,\" so I think it's maybe a self-conscious thing.\n\nAnyways, now in general, I don't like to talk whilst looking at her and if she starts looking at me whilst I'm talking, I immediately stop. The other day I tried to cover my mouth whilst talking and she was like \"that's really shady,\" and I really hate the word shady and anyone who uses it because my mom always uses it to describe things about me she doesn't like - namely that I don't buzz my hair and have a few centimetres of a fringe despite having curly or \"frizzy' as she says, hair.\n\nAnyways, I digress. Point is, I hate this and it's slowly making me feel less and less confident about speaking. Yesterday, when my little brother's Justice League cartoon thing was on my mom said \"their mouths look so weird when they talk, like their lips only move and their jaw doesn't move.\" It felt like my intestines had been tied into a knot and a few tons of adrenaline entered my system in anger and anxiety and stuff.\n\nSometimes I try and move my jaw and stuff when I talk, but I just get anxious and feel so nervous doing it, like all of my mental energy and conscience is focused not on anyone else or my substance, but my lips whilst I'm talking. All of my attention, and my lips start randomly feeling really weird whilst I'm talking and stuff.\n\nI now feel afraid to talk in literally ANYONE, because of that.\n\n\nAs for how my mouth moves, I'd describe as - clench your teeth, and try to speak some sentences, maybe the first few lines of this post. Now that's exactly how I talk, except I actually have a decent voice and I'm pretty eloquent, even if I do say so myself.", "correct_answers": ["Has literally anyone in your life other than your mom pointed this out to you?

They said she was completely wrong and that my laugh is unique, wonderful, and so infectious. I still get a little nervous when I laugh, but for the most part I've put *her* issues behind me.\n\nTL:DR chances are she's self conscious about her mouth and picking on you. Chances also are that she's wrong and your unique quirks will make you more special.", "First; I think your mom could have come at you in a little better way\n\nSecond; Do you notice the things she is pointing out? If so, work on changing it in the mirror. If not, I would just not worry about it.\n\nThird; You can always ask your mom to enroll you in speech.

I'm 25 now, and I don't notice it anymore, so I think it just stopped. I don't know how to describe it really, but I'd look at pictures of me singing or talking and notice that my mouth was like... Crooked or something. I did get braces later (I was 15 or 16) so maybe that had something to do with it going away? Are you in need of braces?", "I had a friend tell me the same thing when I was younger and it made me self conscious too. I obsessed about it for awhile but then just realised that everyone talks or moves their mouths differently. The more you focus on it, the more self conscious you will be.

If you practice enunciation, maybe it will help you?\n\nAlso, could look at yourself in a mirror while talking.

I know it's hard because she's your mom and you value her opinion, but life's too short to be worried about what other people think, especially concerning things that you don't have a lot of control over.  Maybe your mom thought she was helping, but I bet she wouldn't have said anything if she knew it was going to make you more self conscious.", "At age 14 your body and your brain are changing in dramatic ways. I remember having a lot of tics at around that age and it sounds like you're no different. You're got a lot of growing to do, including your jaw, and this is related to that. It's the same reasons teenagers slouch or are clumsy; your brain needs to catch up with the body, and your muscle tone has a lot of catching up to do. Try to take some solace in the fact that teenage bodies do strange things at times and that you'll eventually grow out of this --  both the tic itself, and the self-consciousness.\n\nAs for your mom, it's part of the role of a parent to point out atypical behaviors in their children so that they can be aware of it and eventually stop doing it. Believe it or not she's doing you a favor, because better her than someone who doesn't care about your well being, or a potential romantic partner or employer. On the other hand it is perfectly reasonable to sit down with her and respectfully tell her how you feel. Using phrasing in the form of \"when you do X, it makes me feel Y\" is a great, clear way of telling her that when she laughs at you, it makes you feel self-conscious and insecure. Unless she is someone prone to truly abusive behavior, she does not mean to hurt you by what she's been doing. But it's OK to tell her you feel hurt by it, that you've got the message, and that by continuing to laugh at you, her actions are affecting your ability to talk to anyone. Be patient and persistent, as she may not get it the first time, or the second or third times. Eventually she'll get the message too.", "As they say it's not what you say, it's how you say it, so he's ugly, he spits, but he [drops the mic like the fascist he is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNAnplKWNrc).\n\nThat said, sometimes, it [REALLY is whether](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2pqz41) what someone says is more important than how long it take for them to say it.\nIn reality the real emperor Claudius had a massive stutter and had was thought to have something like epilepsy.", "She sounds like a parent who needs to mind her own business a little more.

Want to learn to get yourself to sleep? Fine, but you're not going to like it for a while.\n\nFirst - you must put yourself on a schedule. Getting your body in the habit of sleeping at a regular time is just like getting your body ready to workout on a regular basis. **You need to go to bed and wake up at the same time for this to work**. Most people seem to think that a sleeping schedule only matters on one end. If you really want to make sure you sleep on a regular basis, then this means weekends too. \n\nYour body goes in and out of REM sleep in cycles, so use [Sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) to figure out what your schedule should be. Everyone is a little different with these schedules, so it won't be exact, but it should get you in the ballpark until you can figure out what works best for you. It's easier to get up if you're not waking up in the middle of a cycle.\n\nSecond - Install [F.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) on all electronic devices you have any chance of using within 3 hours of going to bed. Make sure to set it so that it slowing changes the quality of light (instead of all at once) over the course of an hour. This will change the color balance of your screen so that it appears less blue (which makes your body think it's day) and more yellow (incandescent lighting makes us think it's night). For the first month that you are on a schedule you should turn off all electronic devices 30-90 minutes before sleeping, just to wind your brain down.\n\nThird - Warm milk doesn't do a whole lot. There are other options out there, like [DreamWater](http://www.drinkdreamwater.com/) that have actual melatonin in them, but really you just need to increase your intake of two basic vitamins: Magnesium and Vitamin B-6. Those will help regulate your body in such a way that you will sleep more easily. Take Magnesium twice a day (morning and 30 minutes before bed) and B-6 right before bed. This will help overall, but is not a cure in and of itself.\n\nFourth - If you're the type of person who needs white noise to fall asleep, pick something from [Sound Sleeping](http://www.soundsleeping.com/index.php) that *isn't* a sound you normally hear during the day.

Anyone else who suffered from this, how did you overcome it?", "correct_answers": ["I usually sit down at the computer and write down, word for word, everything I am going to say. I find taking the time to change wording and rearrange the order really gets my brain wrapped around the presentation. Then I read it and read it and read it. \n\nIt is way easier to speak about what you know, and spending that much time builds what I call \"public speaking muscle memory.\" It is the same thing as remembering where \"m\" fits in the alphabet, or recalling the second verse in a song; you have to start before and it just triggers the next stanza or sentence or whatever. I don't memorize them word for word, but I am confident in the flow and the content for each section. \n\nIf I have time, I will pare the presentation down to bullet points on a card, but usually I just space the script out on the page in sections, like verses in a song, highlighting the first sentence of each section in the colours of the rainbow (first section red, second section orange, then yellow) so I can easily find what section I am on. I do this because I just \"know\" the colours of the rainbow and my brain doesn't have to think about it. The script is a backup, and I try to speak conversationally. \n\nFor the really important parts that I don't want to mess up, or for the concluding sentences, I'll write those out like poems, so it is easy to see them on the page and not lose my place if I am reading word for word. Plus, with poem-like phrases, I can read them quickly, make eye contact with the audience  like a functioning human being, and make sure I am confident in my points. \n\nFor formal presentations, I also use some tricks like \"For accuracy, I've written this down, so I am going to read this [statistic/fact/quote] to you.\"  Your audience wants you to succeed, and they want to trust you. It's ok to be honest that you haven't memorized everything. \n\nGood luck!!\n\nTLDR: write it all down. Use familiar colour coding in your notes/script.

It's impossible to mess up a line if you have no pre-set lines. Such a thing may be too hard to do in a short time, since it does take practice in impromptu speech, but it really helps any time you need to talk to a group.\n\nAnd the last bit that probably won't help, stay calm.

My method is not feasible everyone as it requires drastic changes to be made and is essentially a byproduct of unfortunate circumstances but nevertheless, it worked for me.\n\nIf you want to change your lifestyle, you have to change your life. You have to move to a different city. Pick one that isn't in commuting distance from your pothead friends or your dealer. If you have clean relatives in another state, you could move in with them. Without any friends or dealer connections in this new city, it's going to be hard to score any trees.\n\nGo to college or trade school if you haven't already.

The threat of a random drug screen in order to keep your job is a great motivator to keep you from taking your next j-break.\n\nThe key to quitting is to weed out anyone in your life that enables you. If you are willing to make big changes, you will get big results.", "Having been exactly there myself and now 10 years free of that cycle without having gone to any groups or counselling, I can offer my story and what I learnt in the process.\n\nThe problem with weed is that by the time you are smoking it regularly and consider blazing as trivial and normal as having a cup of tea, your social circle has changed so much that pretty much everyone sees it in the same way that you do as those critical of it have been slowly filtered out of your life as much as you have been from theirs.  Now that process is going to start to reverse.  The peer pressure with weed is as subtle as it is strong.  Your first challenge is to physically stop smoking, but prepare yourself for the next challenge that will come from your friends.  I found that a lot of people faded out from my life once I no longer partook in a substance that seemed to be a kind of ritualized \"glue\" holding our friendships together, suddenly revealing them to be rather superficial.  \n\nFor the actual quitting part, I used the old \"one day at a time\" cliche and focussed first on just not smoking anything for just one day.  At the end of that day I actually felt quite proud of myself and slept better than I could remember for a long time.  The following morning I woke up feeling fresher than I had for a long time and then asked myself \"If I could get through yesterday without any, then surely I can today because I actually don't feel all that terrible from lack of it.\" and made it through another day successfully.  The next trick was to remove obvious temptations such as my stash.  Easier said than done, but just get rid of it.  You're in a habit pattern that will always find a way to connect the dots to light up for whatever reason.  \"Well, I achieved (fill in missing whatever) so let me reward myself with a Scooby Snack.\"  Break that.  \nThat was basically it.  I found that after about two weeks I had a moment of weakness and lit up a joint from a stash that I forgot that I had.  Two drags and I felt sick and put it out.  That was the last time I smoked.  Set yourself the goal of not getting stoned each day for a couple of weeks and after a while it will eventually become your new habit and you'll be free from it.\n\nGood luck!", "[Damiana](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/damiana-leaf/profile), satisfied my cravings.  I would mix about 15-20% Damiana, 20% lavender, 60-65% nice rolling tobacco, and the flavor would ease any sort of craving I had.\n\nBesides that, I also had good success with exercising, alcohol, and yeah a job helps too.", "I did this by trying to put back when my first one of the day was. I realized my bedtime spliff would be the hardest one to quite but i used to wake up, have a smoke and then continue to smoke every hour or so.

I don't have any weed, man\" and then go hit up my friend Josh for some.  \nSeriously, the next time you're thinking you ought to beef up your stash, just go \"nah, I'll get some later.\"  And then later on when you run out you can just not smoke.  \nTrust me.

For example, I read a lot as a child.  So I would find a good book to read. Sports, art projects, knitting, sculpting, frisbee, anything recreational.\n\nGo for walks, get outside, do something to be active.  Sensory stimulation will help you not to be bored.\n\nEat nutritious food and drink plenty of water goes without saying.\n\nTry writing about how you feel when you're not smoking.  Many people process emotions better when they write.  You may tap into why you are smoking daily in the first place.\n\nFind people who don't smoke weed and hang out with them.  See if what they do instead of weed is something you are interested in. \n\nDon't hang out with anyone smoking weed or under the influence of weed on days you do not want to smoke.  It's a huge trigger. \n\nYou may need to avoid the activities you normally do while smoking weed for a while.  For example, if you like to smoke weed then watch cat videos, and you only watch cat videos when you smoke weed, then watching cat videos is going to be another trigger to smoke weed.\n\nKeep a record of your progress.  It can help motivate you to see how many days you didn't smoke last month, and try to beat that record for this month. \n\nIf you find you are still smoking and it's interfering with your life, you should consider talking to a counselor.

Your body will thank you.", "Serious Question:  I am genuinely wanting to know - how does someone have the money to smoke weed everyday?    I imagine it's not cheap and easy to get so how can someone keep it up?", "Just Laziness?! Perhaps, laziness in admitting in what others ways its detrimental in your day-to-day life. For myself, it was damaging relationships with my parents (I lived at home) and damaging my sleeping patterns, rendering me often lack-lust and anti-social. Figure out who/what surrounds you and realise that those things could improve without the smoking every day. David Bowie said himself that drug consumption was damaging his relationships so thats why he stopped. I was always getting emotionally addicted to marijuana. I would give up for a few days or a week and not think about it, but then get right back into it: buy a stick or a fifty and smoke by myself in my room or continue to smoke with a friend. I only have one mantra now for not smoking weed, and that is, \"It's not worth it. Not even once.\"", "It's not easy and not fun but quitting is worth it. You need to stop hanging out with people who smoke, you need to delete the numbers of your dealers. Get as far away from the drug as you can, if it's within reach you will most likely smoke it. Lastly, weed dependency is psychological not physical. Quitting is a battle of willpower. Are you going to be in control of your life, or do you want to be controlled by a substance? It gets easier after a week or two. As far as filling the gap goes, pick up something that'll take up a lot of your time. Play an epic rpg, read Infinite Jest, work out, watch all of the X files, anything really.", "It's a habit that is harder to break for some than others.  To me it sounds like you want to ease off more than outright quit. \n\n\nTake everything you have and give it to a friend, including glass, papers, etc. From here you can go two ways. \n\n\nRoute 1: ask them to come smoke with you at greater intervals. First, leave one day between, then two, three, four, and so on. This way you can slowly break yourself out of the habit, and your friend can be a bit of a failsafe. Instead of going to the cabinet whenever you want, you are on a set schedule with that friend. Eventually your tolerance will lower,  and you will be comfortable having it at your reach again without feeling you \"need\" it every day. \n\n\nRoute 2: Tell your friend to hold on to it for a month. That's about the time it takes to break a habit,  usually. The first few days will suck, you'll find yourself wishing you had some, but by the end of the month you will likely be able to look at it objectively and decide if you want to have it back, wait another month, or be totally done. If you get it back you will find, again, a much lower tolerance. You'll likely be one and done for quite a while and you will be fine going days or weeks between hits. \n\n\nIn the meantime, as others have said, hobbies are good, but don't be too ambitious. If you aren't an active person replacing weed with working out will probably make you think \"this sucks, I'm going to get stoned instead.\" Take it easy and go with a walk around the neighborhood to relax nightly, rather than a gym membership.\nAlso avoid things that are \"high activities.\" For example I used to like to get high, listen to vinyls, and paint. Trying to do that after I quit just made me think about how much better it was high. \n\n\nAnd lastly, depending on your will power you don't have to cut your friends out of your life. That will just make you sad and lonely. Instead ask them not to smoke around you or offer it to you until you are ready. I got to a point where I was totally fine rolling a blunt for my friends and sitting with them while they smoked it, but again, that depends on your personal comfort, and will probably take a while to get to. I went from four or five blunts a day to a hit every month or so, sometimes with year-long gaps in between.", "It might be better to cut down slowly. \nMaybe bring it down to once every 2-4 days, then stop altogether after a month, the numbers are yours to play with.\n\nThe reason being is, at least in my experience, a person gets periods of hyper irritability in the 2-7 days that follow, and they might not even attribute it to not smoking because there might be no cravings.", "I was stuck in this loop once. Smoke and play video-games. Smoke and reddit. Smoke and do nothing in particular. Sigh until your lungs are empty and completely sink back into your chair. Be limp. That's how weed was making me feel. Sluggish, tired, lazy. \n\nJust stop. Grow up. Stop buying it. It really only takes a few days to not be incredibly frustrating. A few days for you to feel a lot better. You'll feel proud of your accomplishment. I still crave it, but i just... don't do it. I know it's not going to be worth it. If you honestly want to quit, you do. Stash away the money you would have spent on weed and spend it on something awesome instead. I educated myself, i have a house and a car. I have a family now. \n\nThere's a ton of tiny little things you can do instead. Take a brisk walk, look at your surroundings. Draw a picture. Read a book. Instead of not thinking about your issues, deal with them. Don't make excuses. Look into depression. If you relate, work on that. Just don't smother everything with weed, because it doesn't work at all.", "I was an everyday smoker for a little over 5 years. It started my junior year in high school and lasted until 3 years after I graduated. All my friends and girlfriends I had throughout that time were potheads so even if I didn't have weed some I was with had it.  There were a few times in that 5 years where I wanted to quit but due to constantly being around it quitting seemed damn near impossible. \n\nThe main thing that pushed me to quit was wanting a job that I knew would drug test to be hired but didn't randomly test. I wanted the job because I was tired of working at a restaurant that paid under the table. With no pay stubs to prove my income I was stuck living with my parents, I couldn't finance a new car, and I couldn't buy the new motorcycle I wanted at the time. \n\nThe first and hardest part with quitting was that I had to stop hanging around my friends when they were smoking.  The good thing about my friends is they knew I wanted to better myself so they wouldn't even ask if I wanted a hit here or there. Most of the time they would purposely smoke before I showed up to hang out too. \n\nAfter a couple weeks I no longer had urges to get high so I was able to be around my friend while they smoked. Once I passed my drug test to get hired I thought I was going to be able to smoke again since they didn't random.  Well they ended up making me a forklift diver even though I had no experience in that. Everyone there said forklift drivers at the company were prone to being drug tested so there was my motivation to stay clean.  It has been about a year and a half since I first decided to quit and it only gets easier to stay clean.", "I started working out before smoking a few months ago - I now smoke WAY less, as I often feel so good after lifting that I don't have the desire to smoke. \n\nWhen I do smoke, I make sure to work on a project or clean house etc, so I'm also a lot more productive. You'll need to be careful about picking the right strain tho, I don't touch anything that makes me feel sluggish anymore", "I had to quit smoking weed after I stupidly caught a DWI at a younger age. What I found to really help was doing push-ups until literally my arms were numb and I was oit of breath.", "Hang with a different crowd and change up your habits for a while. Figure out when you smoke (eating, gaming, etc) and just change up the routine.", "Dude, as I guy who JUST got over the same thing, you have to get real with yourself. Look yourself in the mirror and admit to yourself that despite knowing how bad it is, you like to smoke weed. But you also need to make yourself understand that the way you are doing it is not okay. It's no longer fun anymore because you are basically putting your body in constant fun mode so you can barely even make the distinction anymore. I nothing else, AT LEAST designate weed for fun times. Set a time for yourself when you can smoke and use the other time to do something productive. You will eventually end up feeling better in your sober time and uncover because you are actually doing stuff worthwhile, not just sitting around being a waste of space, and you also are smoking as a reward and not constantly. Start up longer projects the further you go along and space out your smoking times more and more. You'll get there eventually. I know it's a cliche thing to say, but Rome wasn't built in a day. Attempting to quit cold turkey may work, but it may also feel like punishing yourself, which may cause you to make excuses for it and slip back into constant use due to still being unhappy in your free time.", "Ask yourself these questions:\n\n\n- Why do I feel the need to stop? Do I really see how not smoking would help me, or do I want to stop because I feel that is the [morally] right thing to do?\n- How am I going to avoid or deal with boredom if I stop smoking? How am I going to avoid or deal with my thoughts?\n- How will I deal with not seeing the benefits of not smoking right from the bat?\n- How will I motivate myself to not smoke?\n-How will I discipline myself into not smoking?\n\nIt's a long, but necessary list, and you have to answer it as it will best work for you.", "As far as filling the gap, if you go to the gym in the mornings or just wake up early and do something productive, then usually shortly after dinner you should be plenty tired.

It doesn't make your life less boring. Treating the symptom instead of the problem. Having a hobby or something to work towards will alleviate boredom in a more concrete way.  Something that will leave you with a talent or skill are my favorite.\n\nHobby Ideas:\n\n**Musical Instrument** - If anything pick up a cheapy electronic keyboard and study up on music theory. $10 hobby right there.\n\n**Programming** - You're already spending all your time on the computer anyway, why not get something out of it?

That's all I got."], "incorrect_answers": ["I sleep very well and am not an expert on why or how.  I have heard, however,  several possible ways to improve sleep.  \n\n1. Stop using your bed for anything but sleep.  No laying down to read or use the phone.  No eating or snacking or hanging out.  Supposedly,  using your bed only for sleep is helpful to induce your body's sleep rituals. \n\n2. No phone or electronics or books within 1 hr of bed time.  The mental simulation of books or electronics makes your mind too active. \n\n3. No caffeine. There are lots of reasons caffeine isn't good for you but the closer you use it to bed time the less likely you'll be able to relax enough to sleep.  It makes your sense of tired preventing you from fading off to sleep\n\n4. This one is sort of weird.  Create a simple ritual.  The one I heard about was sort of silly but supposedly it works.  Anything will do but ideally something low effort and unique enough to not be associated with other activities.  Try, for example,  rhythmically tapping on your legs while laying in bed and every minute or so slowing the rhythm down until you're basically not tapping anymore. \n\n5. Clean yourself and your bed.  Clean sheets and a fresh shower are a great way to increase the cozy factor of your bed. \n\n6. Cold, dark,  and ambient noise.  I use blackout curtains to darken my room at night.  Really heavy duty ones.  It's pitch black in my room during the day of I want it.  I also keep my room cool during sleep times.  Lastly, my brain is easily distracted by outside noises. I use a fan in the distance such as a window across my room to make low level background noise that is rhythmic enough to ignore but loud enough to drown out other sounds. \n\nI can't garuntee these will work for you or that any of them are necessary.  You could experiment with adding them one at a time for a week or two and see if there is a positive change.  Or, add all of them and slowly remove them looking for negative change,  or just try them randomly.  \n\nGood luck!!", "Two suggestions:\n\nIdk how you feel about medication, but I have diagnosed insomnia and my psych prescribed me Trazadone. I swear on my life it is the best thing to ever happen to me. I sleep like the *dead*. No side effects that I can think of, but I'm also on a cocktail of meds so Idk what is from what. Absolute miracle pill, imo. \n\nSecond suggestion: Weed and/or Delta 8 *specifically*. Weed makes me giggly, but extremely sleepy. Delta 8, at least in my experience, will knock your ass *out*. It's also legal (but not regulated!), and you can procure it from your local smokers outlet. The edibles will make you more giggly, the vapes (imo ofc) are what take you down.\n\nI know these are both substances and some folks are real picky but I swear by these two. I sleep like absolute dog shit without one or the other (sometimes both). Best of luck. Also keep your bedroom cold.", "For the melatonin, try a slow release capsule instead of the immediate release. I also saw that they have melatonin for when you wake up in the middle of the night.\n\nHere are some teas I like that make me sleepy: mother's little helper made by David's tea (I buy this online but they have stores in the US and Canada), I also like kava stress relief by yogi teas.\n\nI find that if I have a small high-protein snack and a bit of water when I wake up in the middle of the night (like a protein shake or 2 oz of cheese) I fall back asleep much faster.\n\nTry exercising during the day (but not too late) limit caffeine, etc.\n\nAlso, I read an article a while back that the 8-hour sleep straight through the night is not natural. Humans historically have been what is called bifurcated sleepers. Before electricity people would go to bed shortly after sunset, and wake up at 2-4 am for a couple hours and go back to sleep until the regular wakeup time. I can't remember who specifically but some historical innovators slept in this pattern or just took naps throughout the day and night.", "30-60 minute walk after dinner, or equivalent low-impact exercise.

In my case it's rummikub and I only play against the computer. I started by playing the game when I was already feeling sleepy and gradually I associated the game with being sleepy. I only play when I'm in bed, getting ready to go to sleep.

In the movie you have a introvert who was closed minded and stayed in his bubble. He starting opening up and doing things he normally wouldn't do and his life changed drastically. Start at work. It's the easiest way to practice this. Do more listening then talking, and give good responses. Show interest in what the person is talking about even if it doesn't interest you in the moment, keep an open mind. Also talk to EVERYBODY. If you are wanting a girlfriend don't just talk to hot girls. Don't make finding a girlfriend your main goal. Just talk to everyone as a person and practice. The more social interactions you have the better you will become. You need to practice this skill, it won't come overnight. Be respectfull and nice, and people will flock to you to talk to you.

But I've done these tips throughout my life and my social skills are way better than they were 6 years ago.

There is no other way. /s", "Cultivate a curiosity in other people's experiences. You may be surprised how different they are from your own. In the end, you win because your worldview expands with each conversation. And people will love you for showing so much interest in them.", "Oh I have analysed this and came into conclusion that this is because you are not close with whom you are talking. Because you actually don't know enough or not close enough to be in their world you are having hard time having empathy. This eventually goes away as you start sharing more things, like a job, class, friend enviroment, game etc...", "It's okay to say that, it shows you're relating. Just ask a question in the next sentence to further the conversation.", "You know, one thing that might be playing into this is the questions you ask or the discussion you're having.  Schoolwork is universal (if you're in school) and it's a fairly shallow topic.  What is there to say other than \"me too\"?  However you can turn it around  little bit too.  Say something like \"I think everyone is inundated with schoolwork this time of year...  Are you taking any classes that are actually interesting?\" and see what the response is to that.  It might be a little more lengthy and fun to talk about.  If their answer is \"Not really\" then YOU tell them something about what YOU are studying (assuming it's actually interesting...  Don't tell them all about your economics class unless you think they'll really be interested).\n\nAs mentioned other times in this thread, you should be asking more questions than answering them.  People will love you.  Here's an idea on how to keep things going sometimes.  She mentions she just got back from a trip, or is looking forward to one.  Don't just say \"Cool.  Where are you going?\" and \"That sounds awesome\".  Be really happy for them and know that they are probably more excited then they are leading on, and say something more like \"Holy shit!  That sounds awesome!  I always wanted to go there, TELL ME EVERY SINGLE DETAIL!\"  Maybe rapid fire 2-3 questions in there: \"What was the weather like? What were the people like! Which resort did you stay at? What did you do any excursions?\"  Just some ideas.  This takes the conversation to a whole new level and I think it really grabs people's attention when you aren't just asking to be polite, but you're really interested in what is going on in their lives.  Keep in mind this doesn't work on the aforementioned schoolwork topic.  You need to save this for meatier topics.  \n\nThat person WILL get tired of talking about themselves.  So they'll either change the topic or ask about you.  Here's a protip inside of a protip: Before the awkward silence sets in, LEAVE.  Bump into someone in the hallway? \"Alright I need to get to class!  See ya!\", at a party? \"I'm going to get another drink, you want one?\" etc etc...\n\nBTW, The whole asking about you thing happens less than you think.  It can be annoying.  But that is your new role in the world.  To make people feel comfortable in social situations, to start fascinating conversations and ask nothing in return.  You're like the new Batman of conversation.  You'll go home at night and cry... because you were at that party \"looking for someone to talk to\" and all you did was listen all night. The next party/time you talk to someone they will be more excited to talk to you, that's for sure. And you'll take comfort in knowing that you did your part.  That party was better because you were there.  Good luck!", "Learn and practice [Active Listening](http://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/ActiveListening.htm).

Seriously, this is the #1 LPT for social interactions.", "Like most things, empathy is a good thing to use in conversation, when used correctly. Since it is natural for you to throw in your own experiences to the conversation, trying to prevent that will likely do more harm than good. Instead, just keep doing what you are doing, but try to finish with a question that encourages them to elaborate on their side to drive the conversation. For example:\n\n* \"I've got way too much homework tonight.\"\n* \"Aw, i feel you i had so much work the other day. Got any tips for getting all done?\"", "It's not a bad thing to talk about yourself, especially when you say it like that.\nYou're sympathizing with them.

She's one of those people who never raises their voice at anything besides the occasional football game, so it got my attention.\nAfter that I learned to just pay more attention.

If not, tell your boss you're not going to be doing them anymore.", "First: stop using the term 'burnout.' You are not burnt out, you are being exploited. When you call it burnout, you make it about you and your own limitations. When you call it exploitation you (correctly) name the situation you're in as the problem. \n\nNext: how do you deal with being exploited? You talk to your boss. You go to them and say something like, \"Hey, listen, I've been happy to help out because I know we're in a tough spot, but I've been working 70 hours a week and it's just not sustainable.\" \n\nThen you lay out your current projects/duties. Tell your boss what you can get done in a 40-45 hour week and what you can't and then ask them what you should do. \"I can do X and Y, but not A or Z.\" Or \"I can focus on X, but that means I won't have time to do Y.\" And then, the crucial part, \"What would you like me to prioritize?\"\n\nDealing with this is your manager's job. So make it their job. Ask them to tell you explicitly what tasks or projects they would like you to do, and so therefore which ones have to come off your plate.\n\nIf they tell you \"just hang on for a little while longer until I hire someone\" I would highly recommend giving them a deadline. \"Okay, that's fine, but I can only do this for \\[one more week\\] \\[one more month\\] \\[whatever\\] and then we have to re-arrange things.\" And then stick to it, to the day. If it were me, the moment I got back to my desk after this talk, I'd schedule a meeting for the exact day my stated deadline passes. That way they know you mean it. \n\nIf your boss is at all competent, they'll work with you. They'll help you re-arrange your tasks and projects, or put hiring someone to a higher priority.  \n\nIf they won't work with you, or give you vague promises, or tell you 'everyone works 70 hours a week avocado toast no one wants to work anymore' that's important information for you to have. In which case, I would highly recommend finding another job right away.\n\ntl;dr: take one good-faith run at working with your manager to fix this.

They are taking advantage of you. But you are also allowing it to happen because you feel that you need this job because it pays well.  It will still pay well when you have set firm boundaries around the hours that you will work and what you are able to accomplish in those hours.  When they try to add unreasonable amount of work and unreasonable time frame, ask for direction--\"which of these things would you like me to work on.  I'm working on x and therefore won't be able to work on y until next week.\"   It may be uncomfortable at first because they are not used to you pushing back, but remember that you are not in a sustainable place and your mental health is suffering.  Be respectful but be firm.\n\nAlso consider the fact that if one company is paying you a great salary for the job you do, then most likely another will too.  Start talking to recruiters on Linkedin and inquiring about salaries.  \n\nIf you haven't already, create a budget and determine if you truly do need to make this much.  Are there areas that you could cut back on?  A high salary can be the handcuffs that tie us to toxic jobs.  It can give you a lot of confidence to leave if you see that you will be okay with less.", "Two supervisors in a month, and now they're having you pinch hit for the position?

I do in fact sit on the train as I am writing this.\n\nIt basically boils down to:\n\n* organization\n* information\n* stuff\n* time\n* meaningful activities on the train. i won't go into details here since there are lots of suggestions already.\n\n* get noise-cancelling headphones. I prefer the bose qc 20. lighter and smaller than the big ones. that way you don't have to blast music into your ears to get rid of ambient noise.\n* get ear-plugs as well. i recommend plugs that have been adapted to your ears. much more comfortable. for really getting rid of noise.\n* get lots of data on your mobile, preferably shared between all your devices. that way you can do lots of stuff on the train. streaming, browsing, etc.\n* don't just spend all your commute on reddit. You will regret wasting so much time when you have so little time to spare\n* get a proper messenger bag. preferably one that has a waist strap. A waist strap puts the main weight of your bag on your waist and hips. No more shoulder aches.\n* pack smart. Your bag should be light and not contain anything that you don't use regularly. I recommend going through what you have in your bag regularly, taking out stuff you don't use often.\n* keep your bag in an accessible spot at home. Put everything back immediately when you take something out. This cuts down on packing time and you don't forget anything.\n* find out what your optimal sleep duration is. This way you can optimize the time you are awake without exhausting yourself. I found out that I need about 5:45 to 6 h every night. Stick to it, don't sleep too long on weekends.\n* do not have any important meetings immediately after you arrive at home. There will be delays. Give yourself a margin and have a few things you can do to fill the margin when everything goes smoothly. Don't hesitate to leave early when you have something important. Its easier and more relaxing to work late another day if you plan it and easier then rescheduling most of the time.\n* buy lots of tupperware containers and cook extra food every time you cook. freeze ready-to-eat meals and have a few in your fridge to chose from. That way you get something proper to eat very day without having to cook all the time. Instant time-save.\n* make sure you have identified all sources of information you need for your commute. Especially disruptions on route and delays.\n* notifications should be tailored to your needs. you don't care about delays on the weekend or when you arrive. You don't care about delays and interruptions on other lines. Getting to much info you don't care about will stress you in the long run. You could actually turn this into a project you can work on on the train and program an app for your phone that gives you exactly the info you need. I went even further and wrote some scripts that check delays a minute before my alarm clock goes off which will move my wakeup time half an hour back if there is lots of delays and cancelled trains and informs work automatically. After the alarm goes off my phone starts reading delays aloud. This tells me what to expect before I have left my bed.\n* do not hesitate to wait at home when there are disruptions on your route. It does not help you to stand on the platform. Wait until things go better and take the second or third train that goes. The first is usually packed with all the people who did wait at the station.\n* be open and proactive in your communication about being late. Switch jobs if your boss gives you shit for being late ocassionally. With your commute you cannot be on time all the time.\n* if your working hours are flexible: Use it! It helps a lot to have a few hours extra at home once or twice a week. You get more out of it than just having the same short amount of time at home every day.\n* if you can work from home occasionally: do it! it will save you 3 to 3,5 hours every time you do it! identify tasks you can do better at home than at the office and save them for when you work at home.\n* talk to your boss and negotiate. i can work on the train as much as i want to and i usually use the time to get organized and get rid of emails before i arrive at the office. this reducec the time you have to spend at the office.\n* get a dishwasher and a washer/dryer. having them in the comfort of your home reduces the time you spend on laundry significantly.\n* again if your hours are flexible: try diffferent trains. leaving 10 min later or earlier may be the difference between peace and quiet and feeling like cattle.\n* check if there are other differences between different departures. less stops cuts down noise and movement on the train.\n* find the optimal place to sit. it is better to have personal space and quiet on the way than being off the train first or nearest the station exit. That is where all the really stressed people flock. The really stressed people are usually the ones that stress you the most. check if you can get a better seat by being at the station a few minutes early. This is well-invested time. I recommend having a wall or partition behind you.\n* try different routes to and from the train station(s). it is worth to lose a minute or two for not having to navigate crowds.\n* same goes for traffic lights. eliminate them from your route or wait. crossing on red will add to your stress level. its not much but you stress level margin is thin enough as it is as a commuter.\n* try other exits to leave the station. it might add a minute or two but it is time well spend if you can avoid being part of the herd.\n* for the love of whatever you believe in: don't become one of those people who talk on their phone. respect the peace and quiet that most commuters seek.\n* identify other regulars on the train that annoy you and start to avoid them. its better to be a bit further from the exit when getting off the train than being annoyed by someone for the whole trip.\n* buy a first-class ticket. I started travelling first class and with the tax reduction it boils down to about 1,5 USD per day more but you get: more space, less people, most of them are less noisy (i found that most people who chose first class do it for the peace and quiet) and you are more flexible. Even the peak traffic trains are usually not terribly crowded in first class.\n* identify boring chores and routines that you can save time on. every minute you cut you can use for something more fun.\n* spending money on time-saving is almost always worth it. 15 mins a day more are quite a lot when you don't have much time to spare.\n* get some excercise twice a week or so. doesn't have to be much but it improves your mood and your energy levels.\n* do not get stressed or angry when there are delays or canceled trains. All it does is drain your energy. You can't change it so plan for it and just go with it.\n\ni probably have lots of ideas and tips that i can't come up with right now but i think this is enough to get you going.\n\ntl;dr: spend time and money on saving and building energy and reducing stress. identify time consuming stuff everywhere and optimize. optimize for personal space, peace and quiet where and whenever you can. find something meaningful to do on the train.", "Music and a book.\n\nI had a two hour commute not too long ago.\n\nSoothing music in the morning while I shut my eyes.\n\nOn my way back I will read then take a nap. \n\nSometimes I would listen to an audio book.\n\nI highly recommend John Greene's Mastery.", "Mine is more like an hour, but can take up to 90 minutes if traffic is really bad.

For example, get your clothes ready to go, and have your lunch ready to go. Little things like this help make your morning easier, reduce frustration, and allow you to sleep a couple minutes longer.  \n\nIf you're a coffee drinker, buy a travel mug and make your own coffee at home! It'll save you time and money. I use a carabiner to attach my travel mug to my bag when I'm not using it, so I can keep my hands free.\n\nPack light!

While driving I just listen to music and on the way in I mentally plan.  On the way home though I'm left to my own devices. Generally just loud music and a cigar or cigarette.

When you're constantly trying to MAKE yourself feel tired, you tend to actively do the opposite. People who have trouble sleeping often find that trying to stay awake does the trick, and the opposite is often helpful as well, for me at least.\n\nHope this helps.

The tape on the poster will keep the tack from tearing the poster when you try and take it off.\n\nAlthough, it would probably be better to take the poster to a copy shop or office (depot/max/whatever) shop and get it laminated.  They *might* have a laminator big enough, call ahead first.", "Is the back smooth, or papery? If it's glossy, you can put painters tape on the corners (maybe a few layers on top of each other just to be safe, and then put painters tape on the same part of the wall where it will match up. Use a glue gun (a cool one instead of hot if possible) or gorilla glue to put a dab of glue on the tape on the wall and then press the tape on the back of the poster to it. That way, when you remove it from the wall, you can just peel off the painters tape from the wall, with out damaging the paint, and then can remove the painters tape from the back of the poster. \nOr, you could buy some of the sticky Velcro from the craft store and do the same thing with the tape and instead of glue, stick the Velcro pieces directly to the tape. That would most likely be faster and easier if the print is thinner or not laminated, but make sure you get Velcro that isn't the kind that holds too much weight or you'll be doing so much pulling to unhook it that the poster might get wrinkled or torn.", "Can't you just downvote and move on?

{"id": "advisorqa-145", "dataset": "advisorqa", "question": "Cost effective sound proofing for my apartment floor. Hello everyone, I live in an apartment on the second floor with hardwood flooring. The neighbor below me has told me on multiple occasions that he hears too much noise from my apartment. He said he primarily hears sounds of walking and impacts from dropped items. I bought two area rugs and sound dampening pads and put them down, however he is still telling me it's still too loud.\n\nAdditional information. I live with my girlfriend and two cats. I think he primarily hears the cats when they run around and jump off the couch. We positioned our rugs so the cats jump on the rug instead of the hardwood. To better identify where noise needs to be mitigated, I asked the neighbor if I could come listen in his apartment while my girlfriend walks around upstairs and the cats run around. I want to see if his complaints are legitimate and if there are louder areas than I have already identified. \n\nMy plan is to buy better sound proofing pads and/or rugs, but my searches online show a wide array of cost and a lot of impractical solutions for a renter. Does anyone have a suggestion on how to better sound proof hardwood floors in this situation? And does anyone know a good product to use? I really hate being the source of my neighbor's frustration and want to find a solution​ that satisfies us both. \n\nThanks everyone! Me\n\n***Update: When I made it home last night I went to my neighbor's door and knocked three times. He never answered the door. I know he was home because I could hear him coughing inside before I knocked. After the third knock I saw the lights turn off. Its possible he had headphones in and didn't hear me knocking or he was avoiding talking to me directly. Either way I left him a note saying I had stopped by and then I went to the property management to file a report indicating what measures I've taken to reduce noise. \n\nManagement told me everything that you have all been saying. They felt I had done enough and that if the tenant below cannot handle the normal noise then the problem is his and not mine. They told me they would follow up with him and discuss what is considered normal noise. They told me to let them know every time he tells us we are being too loud. \n\nThank you everyone who responded! I appreciate the input. If anything major happens I'll update again.", "correct_answers": ["If he's bothered by the sound of cats running, maybe he should ask management to move him to a top floor apartment.  It amazes me when people move into a ground floor apartment and expect the people above them to tiptoe around and put socks on their cats' feet."], "incorrect_answers": ["You are a very kind neighbor to be taking such extra steps! \n\nIt doesn't sound like you're doing anything out of the ordinary that would warrant any further action on your end. You may already be doing this, but taking your shoes off and wearing slippers inside could help. Other than that, as long as you're not playing loud music at strange hours and such, your neighbor should learn to accept the realities of living in an apartment.", "Just to add to the chorus, I must say that you are a very considerate neighbor -- much more so than any above neighbors I've had experience with myself.\n\nI'd say the precautions and adjustments that you've made already are more than fair and that you should apologize to the neighbor and advise again of all that you've done to try and accommodate their requests, but politely advise that you've done all that you can to reduce the noise within reason. I would also let your apartment management person/company know that you've taken precautions to prevent any issues so that if the neighbor takes the complaint to them you'll already have a case built in your favor.\n\nIt's definitely a reality of living above/below people that your neighbor is just going to have to get used to... or move. Cheers!", "If he wants sounds dampening he needs to pay for and install it, not you. He can get milk crate foam and tack it to his ceiling. I live on a bottom floor apartment and had to deal with the same thing, I just bought the foam and placed it under key places(under their kids room, master bath, kitchen, and living room) and it got rid of 75% of the sound. The rest you just deal with. I try not to play loud bassy music and they try not to let there kid bounce balls in the house.", "As someone who as lived as the downstairs neighbor, and is now an upstairs neighbor, I get both sides.\n\nYou're being very very kind, but also, your neighbor needs to realize that there are some things and sounds that are just standards of living.  If you're not going out of out you way to make excessive noise, and you're taking precautions to try and do what you can, you're being appropriate.\n\nWhen I lived downstairs, we used to make fun of their cat all the time, thinking \"Wow, they must have an elephant!\"  However, now that we live upstairs and hear *our* cat jumping off of things, we completely get it.  We've also got all hardwood floors.\n\nWhat did you conclude from listening in his apartment? Is it really that bad?  If you've done all you can, at some point you have to say \"Listen, I'm doing what I can to make it work and to be a polite upstairs neighbor.  You had to know what you were getting yourself into being a downstairs neighbor.  I'm running out of rent-friendly solutions, so unless you have any ideas, we may have reached an impasse.\"", "As others have said, you are a very considerate neighbor. I am in an upstairs apartment, and although I haven't heard from my downstairs neighbor, I have done a few things to try and mitigate sound. I have only done it because I can hear them, so I am sure they can hear me. A big area rug in the main room and runner rugs in any area they will fit. Curtains, tablecloths, and any fabrics that can be laid down will reduce the sound level, and echo. But aside from those things, there isnt much you can do that won't cost a small fortune. Leave it up to that neighbor to invest any further.", "Not much you can do since youve already got rugs.

Hello everyone, I live in an apartment on the second floor with hardwood flooring. The neighbor below me has told me on multiple occasions that he hears too much noise from my apartment.

I bought two area rugs and sound dampening pads and put them down, however he is still telling me it's still too loud.\n\nAdditional information. I live with my girlfriend and two cats. I think he primarily hears the cats when they run around and jump off the couch. We positioned our rugs so the cats jump on the rug instead of the hardwood. To better identify where noise needs to be mitigated, I asked the neighbor if I could come listen in his apartment while my girlfriend walks around upstairs and the cats run around. I want to see if his complaints are legitimate and if there are louder areas than I have already identified. \n\nMy plan is to buy better sound proofing pads and/or rugs, but my searches online show a wide array of cost and a lot of impractical solutions for a renter. Does anyone have a suggestion on how to better sound proof hardwood floors in this situation? And does anyone know a good product to use? I really hate being the source of my neighbor's frustration and want to find a solution​ that satisfies us both. \n\nThanks everyone! Me\n\n***Update: When I made it home last night I went to my neighbor's door and knocked three times. He never answered the door. I know he was home because I could hear him coughing inside before I knocked. After the third knock I saw the lights turn off. Its possible he had headphones in and didn't hear me knocking or he was avoiding talking to me directly. Either way I left him a note saying I had stopped by and then I went to the property management to file a report indicating what measures I've taken to reduce noise. \n\nManagement told me everything that you have all been saying. They felt I had done enough and that if the tenant below cannot handle the normal noise then the problem is his and not mine. They told me they would follow up with him and discuss what is considered normal noise.
